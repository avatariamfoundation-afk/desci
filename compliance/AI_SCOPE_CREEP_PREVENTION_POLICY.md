# AI_SCOPE_CREEP_PREVENTION_POLICY.md
Intended Use Integrity & Unauthorized Expansion Control Framework

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory controls to prevent AI scope creep** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Enforce strict adherence to approved AI intended use
- Prevent unauthorized functional expansion
- Protect patient safety and regulatory standing
- Ensure clinical AI systems do not evolve beyond validated boundaries

Scope control is treated as a **regulatory and safety safeguard**, not a development constraint.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI and ML models deployed within NeuroGrid
- Clinical AI, RPM systems, and decision-support tools
- Research models transitioning toward clinical use
- Model updates, retraining, and feature expansion activities

It applies across **Core enforcement**, **MedIntel execution**, and **DeSci governance** layers.

---

## 3. Definition of Scope Creep

AI scope creep includes, but is not limited to:
- Use of AI outside its approved intended purpose
- Expansion into new clinical decision domains
- Introduction of new outputs without approval
- Increased automation beyond disclosed boundaries
- Silent performance or behavior changes affecting use context

Any functional change that alters **risk, responsibility, or interpretation** constitutes scope creep.

---

## 4. Scope Locking Requirements

Every AI model must have:
- A documented intended use statement
- Defined input and output boundaries
- Explicit exclusions and non-supported uses
- Risk classification tied to scope

These elements are considered **locked** upon approval.

---

## 5. Change Control Enforcement

The following require formal approval before deployment:
- New clinical recommendations or alerts
- New patient populations or conditions
- Changes to autonomy level
- Integration into new workflows
- Deployment in new jurisdictions

Unapproved changes are prohibited.

---

## 6. Prohibited Practices

The following are strictly forbidden:
- Repurposing models without review
- Gradual feature addition without disclosure
- Marketing-driven functional expansion
- Research model “soft launches” into clinical use
- Configuration changes that alter clinical meaning

Violations trigger immediate suspension.

---

## 7. Detection & Monitoring

Scope creep is monitored through:
- Model behavior audits
- Output drift analysis
- UI and workflow inspections
- Version comparison reviews
- Clinician feedback channels

Detected deviations initiate mandatory investigation.

---

## 8. Human Accountability

Accountability is assigned to:
- Model owners
- Deployment approvers
- Governance review bodies

No system change may proceed without a named accountable authority.

---

## 9. Incident Response

If scope creep is detected:
1. Immediate containment or rollback
2. Clinical impact assessment
3. Compliance notification
4. Corrective action plan
5. Documentation and audit logging

Patient safety takes precedence over continuity.

---

## 10. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- FDA change management expectations
- EU MDR and EU AI Act scope controls
- ISO 14971 risk management
- IEC 62304 software lifecycle standards
- OECD AI governance principles

---

## 11. Ethical Position

> **An AI system that silently expands its role is unsafe by design.**

Respecting scope is a prerequisite for trust and accountability.

---

## 12. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid AI systems
- Enforced through governance and technical controls
- Subject to audit and regulatory review
- Amendable only via approved governance process
