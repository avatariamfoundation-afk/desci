# INCIDENT_RESPONSE_ROLES_AND_AUTHORITY.md  
**NeuroGrid DeSci – Incident Governance & Command Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **roles, responsibilities, and authority hierarchy** governing incident response within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- Rapid, coordinated response to incidents
- Clear accountability under stress
- Prevention of decision paralysis
- Alignment with global healthcare, AI, and DAO regulations

Incidents are treated as **clinical-grade events**, not technical inconveniences.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to incidents involving:
- AI model failures or anomalies
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) alerts
- Bio-cybernetic device risks
- Data breaches or integrity failures
- Governance or DAO security threats
- Regulatory non-compliance events
- Patient safety escalations

---

## 3. Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Level 1 | Minor issue, no patient or system risk |
| Level 2 | Operational disruption, contained |
| Level 3 | Potential patient impact |
| Level 4 | Confirmed patient safety risk |
| Level 5 | Systemic or multi-patient threat |

Authority expands with severity.

---

## 4. Incident Command Structure (ICS)

NeuroGrid follows a **layered Incident Command System**.

### Core Principle
> Authority flows **upward with severity**, not popularity or token weight.

---

## 5. Defined Roles & Authority

### 5.1 Incident Commander (IC)

**Primary Authority Holder**

Responsibilities:
- Overall command of incident response
- Decision finality during active incidents
- Activation of emergency protocols
- Coordination across teams

Authority:
- Override standard governance processes
- Suspend models or systems
- Trigger emergency shutdowns

---

### 5.2 Clinical Safety Lead (CSL)

**Patient Safety Authority**

Responsibilities:
- Assess clinical impact
- Advise on patient risk
- Define care escalation thresholds
- Validate RPM alert severity

Authority:
- Veto actions that increase patient risk
- Mandate clinical escalation

---

### 5.3 AI Systems Lead (AISL)

**Model & Algorithm Authority**

Responsibilities:
- Diagnose AI behavior
- Assess model drift or failure
- Recommend model suspension or rollback

Authority:
- Freeze inference pipelines
- Recommend emergency model overrides

---

### 5.4 Data Protection Officer (DPO)

**Data & Privacy Authority**

Responsibilities:
- Assess data exposure
- Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, LGPD compliance
- Coordinate breach notifications

Authority:
- Halt data flows
- Mandate disclosures to regulators

---

### 5.5 Security Response Lead (SRL)

**Cybersecurity Authority**

Responsibilities:
- Investigate attacks or exploits
- Secure infrastructure
- Coordinate forensic analysis

Authority:
- Isolate systems
- Revoke credentials
- Enforce access lockdowns

---

### 5.6 DAO Governance Liaison (DGL)

**Governance Interface**

Responsibilities:
- Inform DAO of incident status
- Prepare governance disclosures
- Ensure post-incident accountability

Authority:
- Limited during active incidents
- Advisory role only during emergency phase

---

## 6. Authority Escalation Rules

- Lower roles defer to higher severity authority
- Patient safety overrides all other concerns
- Token voting is **suspended** during active Level 4–5 incidents
- Emergency powers are temporary and auditable

---

## 7. Decision Documentation

All decisions must be logged with:
- Timestamp
- Role making decision
- Rationale
- Risk assessment
- Expected outcome

Documentation is immutable post-incident.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise:
1. Patient safety prevails
2. Incident Commander decides
3. Post-incident review resolves disputes

No delays are permitted due to disagreement.

---

## 9. Incident Closure Authority

Only the Incident Commander may:
- Declare incident resolved
- Transition to recovery phase
- Restore suspended systems

Closure requires:
- Safety confirmation
- Data integrity validation
- Compliance sign-off

---

## 10. Post-Incident Review

Mandatory after all Level 3+ incidents:
- Root cause analysis
- Governance disclosure
- Policy updates if required
- Corrective action tracking

---

## 11. Training & Readiness

- Role holders must be pre-designated
- Annual incident response drills required
- Role substitution plans mandatory

Unassigned authority is a failure condition.

---

## 12. Binding Status

This framework is:
- Mandatory
- Enforceable
- Override-capable during emergencies
- Subject to audit
