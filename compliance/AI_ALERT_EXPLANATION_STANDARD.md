# AI_ALERT_EXPLANATION_STANDARD.md  
**AI-Generated Alert Explainability & Transparency Standard**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory explanation standard** for all AI-generated alerts within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that every alert presented to a human reviewer is:
- Interpretable
- Contextualized
- Clinically meaningful
- Auditable
- Free from false authority

An alert without explanation is treated as **unsafe output**.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to all AI-generated alerts that:
- Consume RPM or clinical data
- Indicate elevated risk, anomaly, or threshold breach
- Prompt human review or escalation

It applies across development, validation, deployment, and post-market operation.
