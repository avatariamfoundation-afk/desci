## 5. Compliance Strategy

NeuroGrid adopts a **compliance-by-design** approach:

- Ethical review precedes development
- Risk classification determines review depth
- Modular architecture enables jurisdictional isolation
- Registry-level enforcement prevents non-compliant deployment
- Human oversight is mandatory for clinical impact systems

---

## 6. Compliance Ownership

Compliance responsibility is shared across:
- Contributors
- Registry operators
- Ethics Review Committee
- DAO governance structures

Non-compliance results in:
- Registry delisting
- Funding suspension
- Public disclosure
- Enforcement escalation

---

## 7. Living Document Policy

This regulatory mapping is a **living document** and will be updated as:
- Regulations evolve
- New jurisdictions are added
- System capabilities expand

Updates require governance review.

---

## 8. Foundational Compliance Statement

> **Global impact requires global responsibility.  
> Regulatory rigor is not a constraint — it is a competitive advantage.**
