# MODEL_ROLLBACK_AND_DEPRECATION_POLICY.md  
**AI Model Rollback, Sunset & Deprecation Governance Policy**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory procedures for rolling back, deprecating, and retiring AI models** deployed within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

The policy ensures patient safety, system stability, regulatory compliance, and full auditability when models are downgraded, disabled, or permanently withdrawn.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **No model is permanent.  
All models must be reversible, replaceable, and accountable.**

Rollback capability is a safety requirement, not a convenience.

---

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:
- Production AI models
- RPM alert models
- Clinical decision-support systems
- Bio-cybernetic inference engines
- Emergency-patched or overridden models
- Legacy and deprecated versions

---

## 4. Definitions

- **Rollback:** Immediate reversion to a previously approved model version
- **Deprecation:** Formal notice that a model will be retired
- **Retirement:** Permanent removal from operational use
- **Sunset Period:** Defined time between deprecation and retirement

---

## 5. Rollback Triggers

A rollback **must be initiated** if any of the following occur:

- Patient safety risk identified
- Unexpected model behavior
- Excessive false positives or negatives
- Model drift beyond approved thresholds
- Regulatory non-compliance discovered
- Data integrity compromise
- Governance or audit failure

Rollbacks may be automatic or manual, but authorization remains human-controlled.

---

## 6. Emergency Rollback Authority

Emergency rollback may be executed by:
- Clinical safety officer
- Compliance lead
- DAO emergency authority (as defined)
- Designated system administrator

Emergency rollbacks:
- Take precedence over governance votes
- Must be logged immediately
- Trigger post-incident review

---

## 7. Rollback Procedure

Mandatory steps:
1. Disable affected model version
2. Restore last approved stable version
3. Confirm operational integrity
4. Notify clinical and governance stakeholders
5. Initiate incident documentation
6. Activate post-rollback monitoring

Rollback without verification is prohibited.

---

## 8. Deprecation Criteria

A model may be deprecated when:
- Superior model approved
- Model architecture becomes obsolete
- Regulatory standards evolve
- Maintenance cost outweighs benefit
- Ethical or safety concerns emerge

Deprecation does not imply immediate shutdown.

---

## 9. Deprecation Notice Requirements

Formal deprecation notice must include:
- Model identifier and version
- Reason for deprecation
- Planned retirement date
- Migration path
- Clinical impact assessment

Notices must be recorded and auditable.

---

## 10. Sunset Period Management

During sunset:
- Model remains operational
- No new deployments permitted
- Monitoring intensity increased
- Replacement readiness verified

Minimum sunset period: **30 days**, unless emergency retirement is required.

---

## 11. Model Retirement Process

Retirement requires:
- Final governance approval
- Confirmation of replacement deployment
- Archival of artifacts and logs
- Deactivation of inference endpoints
- Audit record finalization

Retired models must not be reactivated.

---

## 12. Data & Artifact Preservation

Upon retirement:
- Training data lineage preserved
- Model weights archived
- Decision logs retained
- Audit evidence secured

Deletion without archival violates compliance obligations.

---

## 13. Clinical Communication

If a model impacts patient-facing workflows:
- Clinical teams must be notified
- Patients informed if required by regulation
- Care continuity ensured

Patient safety overrides operational convenience.

---

## 14. DeSci Considerations

For decentralized contributions:
- Contributors have no rollback authority
- Governance controls rollback decisions
- Token incentives cannot delay rollback

Decentralization does not supersede safety.

---

## 15. Audit & Traceability

All rollback and deprecation actions must record:
- Trigger event
- Decision authority
- Timestamps
- Affected versions
- Corrective actions

Incomplete records constitute non-compliance.

---

## 16. Prohibited Actions

The following are strictly prohibited:
- Silent rollbacks
- Unlogged deprecations
- Token-vote-only rollback decisions
- Reactivation of retired models
- Deleting historical evidence

---

## 17. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Model suspension
- Governance sanctions
- Regulatory disclosure
- System-wide emergency controls

---

## 18. Binding Status

This policy is:
- Mandatory
- Enforceable
- Non-negotiable
- Subject to change only via governance vote

---
