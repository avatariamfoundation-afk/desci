# CLINICIAN_OVERRIDE_AND_DISAGREEMENT_LOG.md  
**Human Authority, Override & Professional Judgment Accountability Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory logging and accountability framework** for clinician overrides, disagreements, and rejections of AI-assisted outputs within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Preserve clinician authority
- Prevent algorithmic dominance
- Capture professional judgment
- Enable auditability and learning
- Protect patient safety

Disagreement with AI is not an error condition — it is a **core safety signal**.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all situations where a clinician:
- Overrides an AI-generated alert or recommendation
- Disagrees with AI risk assessment
- Chooses not to act on AI-supported output
- Modifies an AI-suggested pathway

It applies across RPM, clinical decision support, and safety monitoring contexts.

## 3. Foundational Principles

Clinician override handling is governed by:

- **Human authority supremacy**
- **Non-punitive disagreement**
- **Explicit reasoning capture**
- **Auditability without coercion**
- **Learning-oriented f**
