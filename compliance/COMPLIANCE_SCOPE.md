**NeuroGrid DeSci – Global Compliance & Regulatory Scope**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **regulatory, legal, and policy compliance boundaries** governing the NeuroGrid DeSci ecosystem.

Compliance ensures that decentralized scientific acceleration does **not violate**:
- International law
- Regional regulations
- Medical and data governance standards
- Ethical minimum thresholds

Compliance is treated as a **baseline obligation**, not a competitive constraint.

---

## 2. Scope of Application

This compliance framework applies to all NeuroGrid DeSci components, including:

- Dataset registration
- Model development and attribution
- Funding allocation
- Research governance
- DAO decision-making
- AI-driven medical intelligence
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems
- Wearable and subcutaneous bio-cybernetic devices

---

## 3. Global Regulatory Alignment (Non-Exhaustive)

NeuroGrid is designed for **global deployment**, and therefore aligns with the following regulatory regimes as reference standards.

---

### 3.1 Data Protection & Privacy

Applicable standards include:

- **GDPR** (European Union)
- **LGPD** (Brazil)
- **HIPAA** (United States – health data)
- **POPIA** (South Africa)
- **PIPEDA** (Canada)

Core requirements:
- Lawful data processing
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Right to access and erasure where applicable
- Breach disclosure obligations

---

### 3.2 Medical & Health Regulation

Where applicable to post-operative care, RPM, or bio-cybernetic devices:

- **FDA** (United States)
- **EMA** (European Union)
- **ANVISA** (Brazil)
- **MHRA** (United Kingdom)
- **SAHPRA** (South Africa)

NeuroGrid does **not bypass** medical regulatory oversight.  
It provides **infrastructure**, not unlicensed medical practice.

---

### 3.3 AI & Algorithmic Governance

Alignment includes emerging and existing frameworks:

- EU AI Act (risk-based classification)
- OECD AI Principles
- WHO AI for Health Guidelines
- UNESCO AI Ethics Framework

Key compliance themes:
- Explainability where clinically relevant
- Risk classification and mitigation
- Human-in-the-loop oversight
- Model performance accountability

---

### 3.4 Research & Scientific Integrity

NeuroGrid aligns with:

- Declaration of Helsinki
- Belmont Report
- Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
- Open Science principles

Scientific decentralization does **not nullify** research responsibility.

---

## 4. Jurisdictional Modularity

NeuroGrid is architected for **jurisdiction-aware operation**:

- Compliance rules may vary by region
- Registry entries may be geo-restricted
- Funding access may be jurisdiction-limited
- DAO votes may enforce region-specific constraints

Compliance rules are **configurable**, but never disabled.

---

## 5. Compliance Responsibilities

---

### 5.1 Contributors

Contributors are responsible for:
- Ensuring lawful data origin
- Declaring jurisdictional constraints
- Disclosing regulatory dependencies
- Complying with local research laws

Ignorance of regulation is not a defense.

---

### 5.2 Registry Operators

Registry governance ensures:
- Metadata compliance checks
- Flagging of high-risk submissions
- Jurisdictional tagging
- Audit readiness

---

### 5.3 DAO Governance

The DAO may:
- Enforce compliance requirements
- Suspend non-compliant entries
- Adjust funding rules
- Establish compliance review committees

DAO authority does not supersede law.

---

## 6. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Compliance

RPM-related components must ensure:

- Secure data transmission
- Medical device classification awareness
- Patient consent continuity
- Clinician oversight integration
- Incident reporting mechanisms

RPM is treated as **clinical-adjacent infrastructure**, not consumer telemetry.

---

## 7. Bio-Cybernetic Device Considerations

For subcutaneous or implanted systems:

- Pre-market approval pathways must be respected
- Post-market surveillance obligations apply
- Long-term risk monitoring is required
- Ethical review is mandatory

Experimental use must be clearly labeled.

---

## 8. Prohibited Compliance Violations

The following are strictly prohibited:

- Circumvention of regulatory approval
- Deployment of unapproved medical claims
- Misrepresentation of clinical readiness
- Cross-border data export violations
- Concealment of compliance risks

Violations trigger registry and DAO enforcement.

---

## 9. Auditability & Documentation

All compliance-relevant actions must be:
- Documented
- Time-stamped
- Reviewable
- Exportable for regulators if required

Decentralization does not imply opacity.

---

## 10. Compliance Dispute Resolution

Disputes may be resolved via:
- Internal compliance review
- Independent expert consultation
- DAO arbitration
- External legal escalation if required

---

## 11. Evolution of Compliance Scope

This document evolves alongside:
- Regulatory change
- Technological advancement
- Medical innovation
- Global policy shifts

Compliance updates require DAO ratification.

---

## 12. Foundational Compliance Statement

> **Compliance is the license to operate.**  
>  
> Without it, decentralization becomes liability.

---

### Status
**Compliance Scope – Active Draft**  
Subject to jurisdictional updates and DAO ratification.
