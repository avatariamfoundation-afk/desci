# MODEL_POST_MARKET_MONITORING_PLAN.md  
**AI Model Post-Market Surveillance & Continuous Safety Monitoring Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory **post-market monitoring plan** for all AI models deployed within the NeuroGrid ecosystem, including Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), post-operative care, and bio-cybernetic systems.

The objective is to ensure:
- Ongoing safety and performance validation
- Early detection of risk, drift, or degradation
- Regulatory compliance across global jurisdictions
- Continuous clinical trustworthiness after deployment

---

## 2. Scope

This plan applies to:
- All production AI models
- Models used in RPM and post-operative monitoring
- Models interfacing with wearable and subcutaneous devices
- Models integrated into clinical decision support
- Models deployed via decentralized infrastructure

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **Deployment is not approval — it is the beginning of accountability.**

AI models must be continuously monitored throughout their operational lifecycle.

---

## 4. Regulatory Context

This plan aligns with:
- FDA SaMD Post-Market Guidance
- EU MDR Annex III (Post-Market Surveillance)
- ISO 13485 & ISO 14971
- WHO AI in Health governance principles
- LGPD, GDPR, HIPAA continuous compliance expectations

---

## 5. Monitoring Objectives

Post-market monitoring must detect:
- Performance degradation
- Bias amplification
- False positives and false negatives
- Alert fatigue risks
- Data distribution shifts
- Unintended clinical behavior
- Adverse patient outcomes

---

## 6. Monitoring Dimensions

Each deployed model must be monitored across:

### 6.1 Performance Metrics
- Sensitivity
- Specificity
- Precision / Recall
- Alert accuracy
- Latency and uptime

### 6.2 Safety Metrics
- Near-miss events
- Incorrect risk stratification
- Over-escalation and under-escalation rates

### 6.3 Stability Metrics
- Input data drift
- Output distribution changes
- Feature relevance shifts

---

## 7. Data Sources for Monitoring

Monitoring inputs may include:
- Live RPM telemetry
- Synthetic control datasets
- Clinician feedback loops
- Patient-reported outcomes
- Adverse event reports
- Governance audits

All monitoring data must comply with privacy and consent policies.

---

## 8. Drift Detection

The system must continuously assess:
- Statistical data drift
- Concept drift
- Population shift
- Device behavior change

Drift thresholds must be predefined and auditable.

---

## 9. Alerting and Escalation

Monitoring systems must:
- Trigger alerts on threshold breaches
- Classify severity (low / moderate / critical)
- Escalate to human oversight when required
- Log all alerts immutably

No autonomous corrective action is permitted without approval.

---

## 10. Human Oversight

All post-market monitoring includes:
- Clinical review pathways
- Engineering review checkpoints
- Governance escalation protocols

AI must never self-certify safety.

---

## 11. Model Version Tracking

Each model instance must be traceable to:
- Version identifier
- Training data lineage
- Deployment timestamp
- Configuration profile

Version ambiguity is prohibited.

---

## 12. Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)

When issues are detected:
- Root cause analysis must be initiated
- Corrective actions documented
- Preventive controls updated
- Regulatory reporting evaluated

All CAPA actions must be logged and auditable.

---

## 13. Post-Market Reporting

Mandatory reporting may include:
- Regulatory authority notifications
- Internal governance reports
- Clinical partner disclosures
- DAO oversight briefings

Reporting thresholds are defined by risk severity.

---

## 14. DeSci Monitoring Considerations

For decentralized models:
- Monitoring responsibilities are shared
- Governance rules define accountability
- No dilution of safety obligations is permitted
- Decentralization does not reduce liability

---

## 15. Continuous Improvement Loop

Monitoring outcomes must inform:
- Model retraining decisions
- Threshold adjustments
- Alert taxonomy refinement
- Deployment controls

Improvements must follow change-control protocols.

---

## 16. Audit Readiness

Monitoring systems must be:
- Always audit-ready
- Reproducible
- Time-stamped
- Tamper-resistant

Audit failure constitutes a system failure.

---

## 17. Ethical Safeguards

Post-market monitoring must:
- Avoid patient over-surveillance
- Respect consent boundaries
- Prevent silent risk escalation
- Maintain clinician trust

Safety takes precedence over optimization.

---

## 18. Enforcement

Non-compliance may result in:
- Model suspension
- Emergency override activation
- Governance sanctions
- Regulatory escalation

---

## 19. Binding Status

This plan is:
- Mandatory for all deployed models
- Enforced continuously
- Subject to periodic review
- Modifiable only through formal governance approval
