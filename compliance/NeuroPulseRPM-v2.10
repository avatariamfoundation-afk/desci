## 5. Version Numbering Rules

### A. Major Version (X.0.0)
Incremented when:
- Intended clinical use changes
- Model architecture changes
- New patient population is introduced
- Regulatory re-approval is required

**Major versions require full re-validation and approval.**

---

### B. Minor Version (0.X.0)
Incremented when:
- Retraining with new datasets
- Performance optimization without intent change
- Feature engineering updates

**Minor versions require performance validation and audit review.**

---

### C. Patch Version (0.0.X)
Incremented when:
- Bug fixes
- Non-behavioral code refactoring
- Infrastructure compatibility updates

**Patch versions require documentation but not full re-validation.**

---

## 6. Mandatory Metadata for Each Version

Every model version MUST record:

- Model name
- Version number
- Release date
- Author / responsible team
- Intended use
- Training dataset references
- Validation dataset references
- Performance metrics
- Bias assessment summary
- Risk classification
- Approval signatures
- Deployment environment

No metadata = no deployment.

---

## 7. Training Data Traceability

For each model version:
- Dataset IDs must be referenced
- Data source provenance recorded
- Consent status documented
- Data preprocessing steps logged
- Synthetic data usage declared

Training data hashes must be immutable.

---

## 8. Validation & Testing Requirements

Each version must include:
- Internal validation results
- External validation (if applicable)
- Stress testing outcomes
- Edge-case performance analysis
- False positive / false negative rates

Validation artifacts must be archived.

---

## 9. Deployment Controls

- Only approved versions may be deployed
- Active production version must be declared
- Rollback versions must be identified
- Shadow testing versions must be labeled
- Deprecated versions must be blocked from use

Live systems may only reference one active version at a time.

---

## 10. Change Documentation (Model Changelog)

Each version must include a changelog covering:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Expected impact
- Known limitations
- Risk implications

Changelogs must be human-readable and audit-ready.

---

## 11. Model Retirement & Deprecation

A model version must be retired when:
- Performance degrades beyond thresholds
- Drift exceeds tolerance
- Regulatory guidance changes
- Safer alternatives exist

Retired versions:
- Cannot be redeployed
- Must remain archived
- Must retain audit history

---

## 12. Governance & Approval Flow

### Required Approvals:
- Technical Lead
- Compliance Lead
- Clinical Safety Officer (if applicable)
- DAO acknowledgment (DeSci models)

No unilateral version releases are permitted.

---

## 13. Incident & Adverse Event Linkage

All reported incidents must reference:
- Model name
- Exact version number
- Deployment context

Version-level traceability is mandatory for root-cause analysis.

---

## 14. Audit & Inspection Readiness

This standard supports:
- Regulatory inspections
- Ethics board reviews
- DAO audits
- External certifications

Failure to comply constitutes a **deployment violation**.

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

Aligned with:
- ISO/IEC 23053 (AI lifecycle)
- ISO 14971 (Risk management)
- FDA GMLP
- EU AI Act (high-risk systems)
- ANVISA AI oversight
- WHO AI governance guidance

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **A model without a version is an unaccountable system.  
> An unaccountable system has no place in medicine.**

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory for All NeuroGrid AI Systems**

This document supersedes any informal versioning practices.
