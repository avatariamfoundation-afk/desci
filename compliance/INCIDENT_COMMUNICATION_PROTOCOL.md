# INCIDENT_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL
NeuroGrid Compliance & Safety Layer

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **mandatory communication protocol** for incidents within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Ensure timely, accurate, and accountable incident communication
- Prevent information suppression, distortion, or delay
- Align operational response with regulatory and ethical obligations
- Preserve patient safety, system integrity, and governance legitimacy

Incident communication is a **regulated safety function**, not a discretionary activity.

---

## 2. Scope
This protocol applies to all incidents classified under the **Incident Classification Matrix**, including those affecting:
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- Clinical AI models and decision-support systems
- Data integrity, privacy, or security
- System availability and infrastructure
- DAO governance and oversight processes
- DeSci research operations

It governs **internal, cross-functional, and external communications**.

---

## 3. Communication Principles
All incident communications must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Accuracy Over Speed** – No speculation or unverified claims  
2. **Safety Priority** – Patient and clinical safety override reputational concerns  
3. **Need-to-Know Discipline** – Information shared according to role and authority  
4. **Traceability** – All communications must be logged and auditable  
5. **Non-Retaliation** – Reporting or escalating incidents is protected activity  

---

## 4. Communication Triggers
Communication is mandatory when:
- An incident reaches **Severity Level 2 or higher**
- Patient safety may be impacted
- A safety control or safeguard fails
- Regulatory notification thresholds are met
- Governance integrity is compromised

Failure to communicate is itself a reportable incident.

---

## 5. Communication Tiers

### Tier A – Operational Notification
Audience:
- System operators
- On-call engineers
- Clinical support staff (as applicable)

Triggered by:
- Level 1–2 incidents

Requirements:
- Timestamped alert
- Incident ID reference
- Initial containment instructions

---

### Tier B – Management & Compliance Notification
Audience:
- Compliance lead
- Clinical safety officer
- System owner
- DAO operational stewards

Triggered by:
- All Level 2 incidents
- Any incident with potential regulatory impact

Requirements:
- Severity classification
- Preliminary impact assessment
- Mitigation actions underway
- Expected next update time

---

### Tier C – Oversight & Governance Notification
Audience:
- Independent Oversight body
- DAO governance council
- Ethics committee (if applicable)

Triggered by:
- Level 3 incidents
- Repeated Level 2 incidents
- Governance-related failures

Requirements:
- Full incident summary
- Control failures identified
- Interim risk assessment
- Governance actions required

---

### Tier D – External & Regulatory Notification
Audience:
- Regulators
- Clinical partners
- Data protection authorities
- Affected institutional stakeholders

Triggered by:
- Level 4 incidents
- Mandatory reporting thresholds
- Legal or regulatory obligations

Requirements:
- Verified factual disclosure only
- Scope and impact description
- Immediate and planned remediation
- Contact point for follow-up

---

## 6. Timing Requirements

| Severity Level | Initial Notification | Update Frequency |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Level 1 | ≤ 24 hours | As needed |
| Level 2 | ≤ 4 hours | Every 24 hours |
| Level 3 | ≤ 1 hour | Every 12 hours |
| Level 4 | Immediate | Continuous / Regulator-defined |

Delays must be justified and documented.

---

## 7. Communication Content Standards
All incident communications must include:
- Incident ID
- Severity level
- Affected systems or patients (pseudonymized)
- Known facts vs. unknowns
- Immediate actions taken
- Next communication checkpoint

The following are prohibited:
- Attribution of blame
- Unverified conclusions
- Suppression of material facts

---

## 8. Single Source of Truth
A designated **Incident Communication Lead** is responsible for:
- Coordinating messages
- Preventing conflicting narratives
- Authorizing outbound disclosures

Unauthorized external communication is a compliance violation.

---

## 9. Logging & Audit
All communications must be:
- Logged with timestamp
- Linked to incident record
- Immutable once issued
- Retained per regulatory requirements

Audit logs must show:
- Who communicated
- To whom
- What was communicated
- When

---

## 10. Escalation Failures
If communication fails or is blocked:
- Incident severity is escalated by one level
- Oversight body is notified immediately
- Emergency governance authority may intervene

Silence during an incident is treated as systemic risk.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment
This protocol aligns with:
- FDA post-market communication expectations
- EU MDR vigilance and reporting standards
- ISO 14971 risk communication requirements
- IEC 62304 incident handling guidance
- OECD AI transparency principles

---

## 12. Binding Status
This protocol is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid deployments
- Enforced via compliance controls
- Subject to audit and oversight
- Amendable only through approved governance process

Non-compliance constitutes a material governance and safety breach.
