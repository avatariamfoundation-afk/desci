**Patient Consent, Disclosure, and Transparency Framework for Remote Patient Monitoring**

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the mandatory requirements for **patient consent and disclosure** within NeuroGrid’s Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems, including wearable and subcutaneous bio-cybernetic devices.

The objective is to ensure:
- Informed consent
- Continuous transparency
- Legal and ethical compliance
- Patient autonomy and trust

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All RPM-enabled post-operative care systems
- Wearable and implanted monitoring devices
- AI-assisted clinical monitoring and alerts
- Data processing, inference, and reporting pipelines
- All global deployments of NeuroGrid technology

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **No monitoring without understanding. No intelligence without consent.**

Consent is not a one-time event; it is an ongoing obligation.

---

## 4. Definition of Patient Consent

Patient consent is defined as:
- Voluntary
- Informed
- Explicit
- Revocable
- Documented

Consent must be obtained **before** RPM activation.

---

## 5. Mandatory Disclosure Elements

Patients must be clearly informed of:
- What data is collected
- Which devices are used (wearable or subcutaneous)
- How often data is collected
- How AI systems analyze the data
- What alerts may be generated
- Who receives alerts
- How long data is retained
- Their rights and controls

Omission of any element is non-compliant.

---

## 6. AI Disclosure Requirements

Patients must be informed that:
- AI assists in monitoring and risk detection
- AI does **not** replace clinicians
- AI outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Human oversight is always present
- AI models may evolve under governance

No deceptive or simplified AI claims are permitted.

---

## 7. Consent for Personalization

Explicit consent is required for:
- Personalized alert thresholds
- Adaptive monitoring profiles
- Recovery trajectory modeling
- Longitudinal AI learning participation

Personalization is **opt-in**, never default.

---

## 8. Subcutaneous & Bio-Cybernetic Device Disclosure

For implanted or invasive devices, patients must be informed of:
- Implant function and purpose
- Data transmission behavior
- Failure and fallback protocols
- Explantation options
- Emergency override conditions

Consent must be reinforced by clinician explanation.

---

## 9. Data Usage Transparency

Patients must be informed whether data is used for:
- Direct clinical care
- System safety monitoring
- Aggregated research (DeSci)
- Model improvement
- Regulatory reporting

Each category requires separate disclosure acknowledgment.

---

## 10. Decentralized Science (DeSci) Disclosure

When data contributes to DeSci:
- Data must be anonymized or pseudonymized
- No re-identification attempts permitted
- Contribution must be voluntary
- Withdrawal must be honored

Patients retain sovereignty over participation.

---

## 11. Right to Withdraw Consent

Patients may withdraw consent:
- At any time
- Without penalty
- Without loss of standard clinical care

Withdrawal triggers:
- RPM deactivation
- Data flow cessation
- Safe system fallback

---

## 12. Consent Renewal and Revalidation

Consent must be renewed when:
- Monitoring scope changes
- New AI models are introduced
- New data types are collected
- Device behavior changes

Silent consent extension is prohibited.

---

## 13. Communication Standards

All consent materials must be:
- Written in plain language
- Free of technical jargon
- Available in accessible formats
- Localized where required

Legal clarity must not reduce patient comprehension.

---

## 14. Audit and Recordkeeping

Consent records must be:
- Timestamped
- Immutable
- Version-controlled
- Linked to system actions
- Available for regulatory inspection

Missing consent logs constitute critical failure.

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- HIPAA informed consent standards
- GDPR and LGPD consent requirements
- FDA RPM and SaMD guidance
- EU MDR patient rights provisions
- UNESCO AI ethics principles

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **Consent is not permission to exploit — it is a covenant of care.**

Patients must never feel surveilled, coerced, or misled.

---

## 17. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Immediate RPM suspension
- Governance sanctions
- Regulatory notification
- System access revocation

---

## 18. Binding Status

This policy is:
- Mandatory for all RPM deployments
- Enforced across all NeuroGrid systems
- Subject to continuous audit
- Modifiable only through formal governance approval

---
