# CROSS_BORDER_REGULATORY_NOTIFICATION_PLAN.md  
**NeuroGrid DeSci – Global Incident Disclosure Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how NeuroGrid identifies, escalates, and notifies **regulatory authorities across jurisdictions** when incidents occur that may affect patient safety, data protection, AI system integrity, or bio-cybernetic devices.

Its objective is to ensure:
- Timely, lawful disclosure
- Jurisdiction-appropriate communication
- Regulatory trust and transparency
- Avoidance of under- or over-reporting

NeuroGrid treats regulatory notification as a **clinical and legal obligation**, not a reputational risk.

## 2. Scope

This plan applies to incidents involving:
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- Post-operative AI decision support
- Wearable and subcutaneous bio-cybernetic devices
- AI model errors, drift, or misclassification
- Data breaches or unauthorized access
- Governance or DAO security failures

---

## 3. Trigger Conditions for Notification

Notification is required when **any** of the following occur:

- Patient harm or credible risk of harm
- Loss of data confidentiality, integrity, or availability
- AI behavior deviating from approved clinical scope
- Unauthorized cross-border data transfer
- Bio-cybernetic device malfunction
- Regulatory threshold breach under local law

## 4. Jurisdictional Coverage

NeuroGrid operates under a **multi-regulatory alignment model
