**Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) – Clinical Alert Classification Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines a standardized taxonomy for **clinical alerts generated by Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

The taxonomy ensures:
- Patient safety
- Clinical interpretability
- Regulatory compliance
- Non-automation of medical decisions
- Clear escalation pathways

Alerts are **signals**, not diagnoses.

---

## 2. Core Principles

All RPM alerts must adhere to the following principles:

- **Non-diagnostic**: Alerts do not constitute medical diagnoses
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Clinical judgment is mandatory
- **Explainable**: Alert triggers must be interpretable
- **Proportionate**: Severity reflects actual risk
- **Auditable**: All alerts are logged and reviewable

---

## 3. Alert Classification Levels

RPM alerts are classified into **five severity tiers**.

### Level 0 — Informational Signal
**Code:** `RPM-L0`

- Data deviation within expected variance
- No clinical action required
- Logged for trend analysis only

Examples:
- Minor heart rate fluctuation
- Temporary sensor noise
- Expected post-activity changes

---

### Level 1 — Observation Alert
**Code:** `RPM-L1`

- Mild deviation from baseline
- No immediate risk
- May warrant clinician awareness

Examples:
- Slight blood pressure elevation
- Mild glucose trend drift
- Non-persistent oxygen saturation change

Action:
- Monitor
- Flag in dashboard
- No patient notification by default

---

### Level 2 — Clinical Advisory Alert
**Code:** `RPM-L2`

- Clinically relevant deviation
- Potential early indicator
- Requires clinician review within defined time window

Examples:
- Sustained tachycardia
- Recurrent hypoglycemia patterns
- Consistent sleep apnea indicators

Action:
- Notify assigned clinician
- Document review outcome
- No automated patient instruction

---

### Level 3 — Urgent Clinical Alert
**Code:** `RPM-L3`

- High-risk physiological deviation
- Potential for harm if ignored
- Time-sensitive review required

Examples:
- Severe hypertension readings
- Dangerous oxygen desaturation
- Post-operative complication indicators

Action:
- Immediate clinician notification
- Escalation protocol triggered
- Human confirmation required before patient contact

---

### Level 4 — Critical Safety Alert
**Code:** `RPM-L4`

- Immediate threat to patient safety
- Potentially life-threatening
- Emergency escalation required

Examples:
- Cardiac arrhythmia patterns
- Acute respiratory failure signals
- Sudden neurological anomaly patterns

Action:
- Emergency escalation
- Override notification hierarchy
- Explicit handoff to emergency services (human-mediated)

---

## 4. Alert Generation Constraints

RPM systems **must not**:

- Auto-diagnose conditions
- Prescribe actions
- Trigger emergency services autonomously
- Replace clinical judgment

Alert generation must be:
- Threshold-based
- Trend-based
- Context-aware
- Sensor-confidence weighted

---

## 5. Alert Escalation Matrix

| Alert Level | Automation | Human Review | Patient Contact |
|------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| L0 | Yes | No | No |
| L1 | Yes | Optional | No |
| L2 | Yes | Required | Conditional |
| L3 | Partial | Immediate | Clinician-mediated |
| L4 | Minimal | Mandatory | Emergency protocol |

---

## 6. Clinical Responsibility Boundaries

- Alerts do **not** transfer liability to the DAO
- Clinical responsibility remains with licensed professionals
- RPM outputs are decision-support tools only

---

## 7. Logging & Audit Requirements

Each alert must log:

- Timestamp
- Data source(s)
- Trigger logic
- Severity level
- Review outcome
- Escalation actions

Logs must be immutable and regulator-accessible.

---

## 8. Bias & Error Mitigation

The alert system must account for:

- Sensor error
- Demographic variance
- Baseline personalization
- Contextual false positives

Periodic recalibration is mandatory.

---

## 9. Regulatory Alignment

This taxonomy aligns with:

- FDA RPM guidance
- EU MDR post-market surveillance
- ISO 14971 (risk management)
- IEC 62304 (medical software lifecycle)
- HIPAA / LGPD data protection principles

---

## 10. Prohibited Practices

The following are forbidden:

- Alert-to-action automation
- Black-box alert logic
- Unreviewed alert escalation
- Patient instruction without clinician review

---

## 11. Review & Update Cycle

This taxonomy is reviewed:

- Annually
- After adverse events
- Upon regulatory updates
- Following clinical feedback loops

---

## 12. Foundational Statement

> **An alert is a warning — not a verdict.**  
> **Care begins with human judgment.**

---

### Status
**RPM Clinical Alert Taxonomy – Active Draft**  
Applies to all NeuroGrid RPM, post-operative monitoring, and AI-assisted clinical signal systems.
