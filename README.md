# NeuroGrid DeSci

NeuroGrid DeSci is the decentralized science layer: research registry, tokenized funding, reproducibility, and verified publication. It enables community funding of replication studies, open datasets for privacy-preserving reanalysis, and on-chain provenance for published medical findings.

Key focus:
- Study and trial registry
- Tokenized micro-grants and funding pools
- Reproducibility artifacts and proof ledger
- Peer-review and reputation mechanics
