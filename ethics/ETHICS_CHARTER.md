**NeuroGrid DeSci Ethics Framework – Core Charter**

---

## 1. Purpose

This Ethics Charter establishes the foundational ethical principles governing all activities within the NeuroGrid DeSci ecosystem.

It applies to:
- Datasets
- Models
- Research contributions
- Funding decisions
- Governance actions
- Registry operations

Ethics within NeuroGrid are **not optional**, **not contextual**, and **not overridden by incentives**.

---

## 2. Ethical Primacy Statement

> **Scientific progress without ethics is not progress.**

The NeuroGrid ecosystem exists to advance human knowledge while preserving:
- Human dignity
- Research integrity
- Societal trust
- Long-term public benefit

All technical, economic, and governance mechanisms are subordinate to ethical constraints.

---

## 3. Core Ethical Principles

---

### 3.1 Human-Centric Integrity

- Human welfare supersedes technological ambition
- No research may knowingly cause harm without overwhelming and transparent justification
- Vulnerable populations require heightened protection

---

### 3.2 Informed Consent & Legitimacy

- Data must originate from lawful and consensual sources
- Consent must be:
  - Explicit
  - Informed
  - Revocable where legally required
- Synthetic or derived data must not circumvent consent obligations

---

### 3.3 Privacy & Data Minimization

- Only data strictly necessary for research objectives may be used
- De-identification is mandatory where possible
- Re-identification attempts are strictly prohibited

Privacy violations constitute ethical breach regardless of legal technicalities.

---

### 3.4 Scientific Honesty

- Fabrication, falsification, or selective reporting is forbidden
- Negative or null results must not be suppressed
- Limitations must be clearly disclosed

Integrity of method is as important as outcome.

---

### 3.5 Attribution & Credit Fairness

- Contributors must receive accurate attribution
- Power asymmetry does not justify credit erosion
- Lineage must be preserved for all derivatives

Misattribution is considered ethical misconduct.

---

### 3.6 Transparency & Auditability

- Ethical review processes must be documented
- Decisions must be explainable and reviewable
- Black-box governance is unethical governance

---

### 3.7 Non-Exploitation

- No exploitation of individuals, communities, or nations
- Extractive data practices are prohibited
- Benefits must be proportionate and disclosed

---

### 3.8 Dual-Use Awareness

- Research with potential harmful secondary use requires enhanced scrutiny
- Dual-use does not imply prohibition, but demands safeguards
- Deliberate misuse facilitation is forbidden

---

## 4. Prohibited Activities

The following are explicitly prohibited:

- Use of unlawfully obtained data
- Coercive or deceptive data collection
- Research designed for harm
- Unauthorized surveillance applications
- Obfuscation of ethical risk
- Circumvention of review processes

Violation results in immediate registry action.

---

## 5. Ethical Review Mechanisms

---

### 5.1 Ethics Review Committee (ERC)

The DAO may establish an ERC to:
- Review sensitive submissions
- Flag high-risk contributions
- Recommend sanctions or safeguards
- Issue binding ethics advisories

---

### 5.2 Trigger Conditions for Review

Ethics review is triggered by:
- Human subject involvement
- Medical or clinical relevance
- Biometric or neurological data
- Dual-use risk tendency
- Public or contributor complaints

---

## 6. Enforcement & Sanctions

Ethical violations may result in:

- Registry delisting
- Funding revocation
- Attribution suspension
- Contributor blacklisting
- DAO-level sanctions

Severity is proportional to harm and intent.

---

## 7. Appeals & Due Process

All accused parties are entitled to:
- Disclosure of allegations
- Opportunity to respond
- Review by independent committee
- Escalation to DAO vote if required

Ethics enforcement must itself be ethical.

---

## 8. Jurisdictional & Cultural Sensitivity

Ethical standards acknowledge:
- Cultural diversity
- Jurisdictional variation
- Legal obligations

However, **minimum ethical thresholds are universal**.

Local norms cannot justify harm.

---

## 9. Ethics vs. Incentives

Economic incentives must never:
- Pressure unethical behavior
- Reward ethical shortcuts
- Encourage opacity

Where incentive mechanisms conflict with ethics, incentives must be redesigned.

---

## 10. Evolution of the Charter

This charter may evolve through:
- Public consultation
- Expert review
- DAO ratification
- Backward-compatible amendments

Ethical regression is not permitted.

---

## 11. Foundational Declaration

> **Ethics are the operating system of trust.**  
>  
> Without trust, decentralized science collapses.

---

### Status
**Ethics Charter – Active Draft**  
Subject to DAO ratification and continuous review.
