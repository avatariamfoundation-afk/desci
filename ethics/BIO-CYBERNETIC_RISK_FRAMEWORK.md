# BIO-CYBERNETIC_RISK_FRAMEWORK.md  
**NeuroGrid Bio-Cybernetic Risk Governance Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework defines how **bio-cybernetic risks** are identified, assessed, mitigated, and governed across the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Bio-cybernetic risk refers to **harm arising from the interaction between biological systems and computational, networked, or AI-driven systems**, particularly where feedback loops, autonomy, or data mediation are involved.

---

## 2. Definition of Bio-Cybernetic Systems

Within NeuroGrid, a bio-cybernetic system is any system that:

- Interfaces with biological data or physiology  
- Influences clinical, behavioral, or physiological outcomes  
- Incorporates AI, automation, or algorithmic mediation  
- Operates within a feedback or control loop affecting humans  

Examples include:
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- AI-assisted diagnostics
- Wearable-driven feedback systems
- Implant-adjacent analytics
- Human-AI decision support pipelines

---

## 3. Core Risk Categories

Bio-cybernetic risk is evaluated across **six primary domains**.

---

### 3.1 Physiological Risk

Risks affecting physical health or bodily integrity.

Examples:
- Incorrect anomaly detection
- False reassurance or false alarms
- Signal misinterpretation
- Latency-induced harm

Mitigation:
- Conservative alert thresholds
- Physician-validated escalation
- Redundant monitoring pathways

---

### 3.2 Cognitive & Behavioral Risk

Risks affecting cognition, perception, or behavior.

Examples:
- Over-reliance on AI outputs
- Automation bias in clinicians
- Patient anxiety amplification
- Behavioral nudging without awareness

Mitigation:
- Explainable outputs
- Human-in-the-loop enforcement
- Explicit AI disclosure

---

### 3.3 Systemic Feedback Risk

Risks arising from feedback loops between AI systems and biological responses.

Examples:
- Adaptive models reinforcing pathological patterns
- Escalation loops without human intervention
- Compounding model drift

Mitigation:
- Feedback loop mapping
- Bounded adaptation
- Mandatory review points

---

### 3.4 Data Integrity & Cyber Risk

Risks related to data manipulation, leakage, or corruption.

Examples:
- Sensor spoofing
- Model poisoning
- Inference attacks
- Unauthorized access

Mitigation:
- Cryptographic integrity checks
- Anomaly detection on inputs
- Zero-trust access controls

---

### 3.5 Ethical & Autonomy Risk

Risks undermining human autonomy, consent, or dignity.

Examples:
- Covert inference
- Secondary use without consent
- Algorithmic discrimination
- Loss of patient agency

Mitigation:
- Explicit consent mechanisms
- Opt-out rights
- Ethics review gating

---

### 3.6 Regulatory & Societal Risk

Risks related to legal non-compliance or societal harm.

Examples:
- Unapproved clinical deployment
- Jurisdictional violations
- Public trust erosion

Mitigation:
- Regulatory mapping
- Deployment controls
- Post-market surveillance

---

## 4. Risk Classification Matrix

Each system is evaluated using a **Bio-Cybernetic Risk Index (BCRI)**:

| Level | Description |
|-----|------------|
| BCRI-1 | Informational / Research Only |
| BCRI-2 | Non-Clinical Decision Support |
| BCRI-3 | Clinical Advisory (Human Review Required) |
| BCRI-4 | Continuous Monitoring / High Impact |
| BCRI-5 | Prohibited / Requires Redesign |

RPM systems are **minimum BCRI-4**.

---

## 5. Mandatory Safeguards by Risk Level

| Risk Level | Mandatory Controls |
|----------|-------------------|
| BCRI-1 | Data anonymization |
| BCRI-2 | Audit logging |
| BCRI-3 | Explainability + clinician review |
| BCRI-4 | Human-in-the-loop + escalation governance |
| BCRI-5 | Deployment forbidden |

---

## 6. Human Oversight Doctrine

NeuroGrid enforces a **Human Supremacy Principle**:

- AI may recommend
- AI may flag
- AI may prioritize

AI may **never**:
- Diagnose autonomously
- Initiate treatment
- Override clinician authority

---

## 7. Model Adaptation Controls

For adaptive or learning systems:

- Learning boundaries must be predefined
- Training data updates require approval
- Rollback capability is mandatory
- Continuous validation is enforced

Unbounded self-optimization is prohibited.

---

## 8. Cross-System Interaction Risk

When multiple systems interact:

- Compound risk must be assessed
- Emergent behaviors must be modeled
- Interaction effects documented
- System-of-systems review required

---

## 9. Incident Response for Bio-Cybernetic Harm

Incidents trigger:

1. Immediate system freeze (if applicable)
2. Clinical review
3. Ethics board notification
4. Regulatory assessment
5. Public transparency if required

---

## 10. Governance & Accountability

Oversight bodies include:

- Ethics Review Board
- Clinical Governance Committee
- DAO Compliance Council
- Regulatory Liaison Authority

Responsibility is **never delegated to software**.

---

## 11. Prohibited Architectures

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- Fully autonomous bio-cybernetic control loops
- Hidden adaptive behavior
- Irreversible system learning
- Non-consensual biofeedback

---

## 12. Review & Evolution

This framework is reviewed:

- Annually
- After critical incidents
- Upon major regulatory change
- Prior to expanding clinical scope

---

## 13. Foundational Statement

> **Where biology meets computation,  
> restraint is a feature — not a limitation.**
