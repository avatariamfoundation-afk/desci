# NeuroGrid DeSci Registry — Overview

## 1. Purpose

The NeuroGrid DeSci Registry exists to provide a **public, verifiable, and ethically grounded record** of decentralized scientific activity conducted within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is not data storage, but **scientific attestation**: a cryptographic record that *something occurred*, *by whom*, *under which rules*, and *with what declared intent*.

The registry acts as the **trust substrate** connecting:

* Post‑operative monitoring requests
* Decentralized AI model development
* Dataset contributions
* Research outputs and derivative works

---

## 2. What Is Registered (and What Is Not)

### Registered

The registry records **metadata hashes and declarations**, including:

* Monitoring case initiation events
* Dataset existence claims (hash + policy reference)
* Model training runs and attribution anchors
* Research outputs and versioned updates
* Funding allocations and milestone attestations

### Explicitly Not Registered

The registry **never stores**:

* Raw patient data
* Personally identifiable information (PII)
* Medical images, scans, or signals
* Proprietary algorithms or weights

All sensitive material remains **off‑chain**, under local custody, federated systems, or approved secure environments.

---

## 3. Relationship to NeuroGrid Core

The DeSci Registry is logically downstream of **NeuroGrid Core**.

* NeuroGrid Core emits on‑chain events (e.g. post‑operative monitoring requests)
* The DeSci Registry contextualizes those events within a scientific framework
* Registry entries reference Core events via immutable identifiers

This separation ensures:

* Clinical logic remains minimal and auditable
* Scientific attribution remains flexible and extensible
* Governance can evolve without rewriting clinical contracts

---

## 4. Scientific Scope

The registry supports, but is not limited to:

* Remote patient monitoring (RPM)
* Post‑operative outcome analysis
* Predictive healthcare research
* Federated and privacy‑preserving AI
* Human cybernetic systems

All registered activity must declare:

* Research intent
* Methodological boundaries
* Known limitations

---

## 5. Attribution and Credit

Every registry entry is attributable to:

* A wallet or organizational address
* A declared role (researcher, contributor, validator)
* A governing policy document

This ensures contributors receive:

* Scientific credit
* Transparent provenance
* Protection against misappropriation

Detailed rules are defined in `MODEL_ATTRIBUTION.md` and `CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md`.

---

## 6. Ethics and Compliance Boundary

The registry is **ethics‑aware but ethics‑agnostic** at the protocol layer.

Meaning:

* Ethical and compliance principles are declared in linked documents
* The registry enforces *structure*, not ideology
* Jurisdiction‑specific compliance occurs off‑chain

This design allows global participation while respecting local regulation.

---

## 7. Governance Relationship

Registry operations are subject to:

* DAO‑defined scope and limitations
* Transparent governance proposals
* Community oversight for rule changes

Governance **cannot** retroactively alter historical registry entries.

---

## 8. Why This Matters

The NeuroGrid DeSci Registry exists to answer a single question:

> *“Can decentralized science be trusted without central authority?”*

Our answer is:

**Yes — if structure, attribution, and restraint are built in from the start.**

---

## 9. Living Document

This overview is intentionally concise.

It evolves only through:

* Governance approval
* Documented versioning
* Public visibility

No silent changes. No hidden clauses.
