**NeuroGrid DeSci System Logic & Governance Flow Definition**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative system logic** for the NeuroGrid DeSci layer.  
It specifies how decentralized governance, research coordination, registries, funding, and compliance operate **without influencing clinical decision-making**.

This document establishes **hard separation** between DeSci coordination logic and MedIntel clinical AI logic.

---

## 2. System Classification

The DeSci layer is classified as:
- **Non-clinical**
- **Coordination and governance infrastructure**
- **Compliance-constrained DAO**
- **Registry-anchored accountability system**

The DeSci layer **does not** generate, interpret, or act upon clinical data.

---

## 3. Authority Boundary

The DeSci system:
- May govern processes, permissions, and records
- May allocate funding and resources
- May approve or retire research artifacts
- May anchor immutable registries

The DeSci system **may not**:
- Influence clinical decisions
- Override MedIntel safeguards
- Interpret patient data
- Control AI outputs or thresholds

Authority boundaries are immutable.

---

## 4. High-Level DeSci Flow

1. Proposal submission
2. Compliance and ethics screening
3. Domain-specific review
4. DAO voting (constrained)
5. Registry anchoring
6. Funding or coordination execution
7. Audit and transparency logging
8. Post-action verification

Each step is mandatory unless explicitly exempted by policy.

---

## 5. Proposal Logic

Proposals may concern:
- Research initiatives
- Registry updates
- Governance policies
- Funding allocations
- Oversight actions

Proposal logic enforces:
- Defined proposal types
- Restricted proposal categories
- Mandatory disclosures
- Conflict-of-interest checks

Proposals affecting clinical systems are **procedural only** and may not dictate outcomes.

---

## 6. Compliance & Ethics Logic

All proposals undergo:
- Regulatory compatibility screening
- Ethics alignment verification
- Safety boundary confirmation

Non-compliant proposals are rejected before voting.

Compliance logic cannot be bypassed by governance action.

---

## 7. DAO Voting Logic

DAO voting:
- Operates under qualified decentralization
- Applies role-based voting classes
- Enforces quorum and supermajority rules
- Is subject to non-votable constraints

The DAO cannot vote to weaken:
- Safety requirements
- Regulatory obligations
- Ethical enforcement mechanisms

---

## 8. Registry Logic

The DeSci layer maintains registries for:
- Governance decisions
- Research artifacts
- Policy versions
- Funding actions
- Audit references

Registry rules:
- Entries are immutable once anchored
- Updates require new entries, not modification
- All entries are timestamped and attributable

---

## 9. Funding & Resource Allocation Logic

Funding decisions:
- Follow approved proposals
- Are bound by compliance conditions
- Are auditable end-to-end

Funding may not be conditioned on:
- Desired clinical outcomes
- Model performance targets
- Patient impact manipulation

---

## 10. Research Coordination Logic

DeSci may coordinate:
- Research participation
- Data access approvals (non-clinical)
- Publication and disclosure processes

Research outputs must:
- Comply with ethics and consent rules
- Be reproducible
- Be registry-linked

---

## 11. Transparency & Audit Logic

The system enforces:
- Public transparency where lawful
- Role-based disclosure
- Immutable audit trails
- Long-term record retention

Transparency may be limited only by:
- Patient privacy laws
- Security requirements
- Legal constraints

---

## 12. Incident & Escalation Logic

DeSci incidents include:
- Governance breaches
- Registry integrity issues
- Compliance failures
- Oversight violations

Incident handling:
- Preserves evidence
- Triggers independent review
- May suspend governance actions
- Cannot suppress findings

---

## 13. Emergency Logic

In emergencies:
- Governance actions may be paused
- Oversight bodies may intervene
- Registry anchoring continues

Emergency actions:
- Are time-bound
- Require post-event review
- May not expand authority scope

---

## 14. Separation from MedIntel

The DeSci system:
- References MedIntel artifacts for traceability only
- Does not control MedIntel runtime behavior
- Cannot modify clinical logic or thresholds

MedIntel clinical authority is absolute within its domain.

---

## 15. Failure Mode Logic

On failure:
- Default state is governance suspension
- Registries remain accessible
- Clinical systems remain unaffected
- Audit processes are preserved

Governance failure must not cascade into clinical risk.

---

## 16. Regulatory Alignment

This system logic aligns with:
- DAO legal governance principles
- EU AI Act governance expectations
- ISO compliance management standards
- Research ethics frameworks
- DeSci best practices
