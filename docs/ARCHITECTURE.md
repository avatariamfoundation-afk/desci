## 1. Architectural Objective

This document defines the **end-to-end DeSci system architecture**, explicitly addressing the previously unallocated gaps:

- Protocol without interface
- Absence of demos
- Perceived imbalance between completed and remaining work

The architecture is designed to ensure:
- Scientific legitimacy
- Composability
- Incremental delivery
- Interface parity with protocol depth
- Clear demo and milestone paths

## 2. Architectural Principles

1. **Protocol First, Interface Enabled**
2. **Scientific Records Are Immutable; Interpretations Are Forkable**
3. **Trust Is Explicit and Bounded**
4. **All Layers Are Independently Replaceable**
5. **Demos Are First-Class Citizens**
6. **Nothing Critical Exists Only Off-Chain**
