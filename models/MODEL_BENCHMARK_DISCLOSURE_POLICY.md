# MODEL_BENCHMARK_DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md

## 1. PURPOSE
This policy defines the mandatory rules governing the disclosure of AI model benchmark results within the DeSci repository. Its objective is to ensure that benchmark information is communicated transparently, accurately, and responsibly without creating clinical risk, misleading stakeholders, or overstating system capability.

Benchmark disclosure is a governance-controlled act, not a marketing exercise.

## 2. SCOPE
This policy applies to disclosure of:
- Internal model benchmarking results
- Comparative performance evaluations
- Validation and testing metrics
- Post-deployment performance summaries
- Public or stakeholder-facing benchmark communications

Both internal and external disclosures are in scope.

## 3. DISCLOSURE PRINCIPLES
All benchmark disclosures must adhere to:
- Clinical safety prioritization
- Scientific rigor and accuracy
- Contextual completeness
- Non-misleading representation
- Regulatory and ethical compliance

Benchmarks must inform understanding, not imply autonomy or superiority.

## 4. DISCLOSABLE BENCHMARK CONTENT
Subject to approval, the following may be disclosed:
- Evaluation objectives and scope
- Benchmark datasets (at a descriptive level)
- Performance metrics and confidence intervals
- Validation methodologies
- Known limitations and failure modes

Disclosures must be proportional to audience and use case.

## 5. PROHIBITED DISCLOSURES
The following are prohibited:
- Claims of diagnostic or therapeutic autonomy
- Selective or cherry-picked metrics
- Comparisons lacking methodological equivalence
- Disclosure of sensitive datasets or identifiers
- Performance claims unsupported by validation

Misleading benchmark presentation constitutes a governance violation.

## 6. CONTEXTUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS
All disclosed benchmarks must include:
- Intended use context
- Population and data constraints
- Model version and configuration
- Evaluation environment
- Explicit uncertainty statements

Benchmarks without context are invalid.

## 7. COMPARATIVE BENCHMARKING CONTROLS
When comparing models or systems:
- Evaluation conditions must be equivalent
- Differences must be explicitly stated
- External benchmarks must be verifiable
- Methodological limitations must be disclosed

Unfair or opaque comparisons are prohibited.

## 8. REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS
Benchmark disclosures require:
- Scientific and technical review
- Clinical safety assessment where applicable
- Compliance and governance approval
- Documentation of approval decision

Unapproved disclosures are non-compliant.

## 9. TIMING OF DISCLOSURE
Benchmarks may only be disclosed when:
- Results are validated
- Data and models are stable
- Material risks are assessed
- Interpretive guidance is prepared

Premature disclosure is prohibited.

## 10. PUBLIC COMMUNICATION CONTROLS
Public-facing benchmark disclosures must:
- Avoid clinical claims
- Avoid performance guarantees
- Avoid regulatory misrepresentation
- Clearly state advisory-only status

Marketing-style benchmark use is prohibited.

## 11. CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES
If benchmark information becomes inaccurate:
- Corrections must be issued promptly
- Updates must reference prior disclosures
- Downstream reliance must be assessed

Failure to correct constitutes a governance breach.

## 12. RECORDKEEPING
All benchmark disclosures must be:
- Logged and versioned
- Traceable to underlying evaluations
- Retained for audit and oversight
- Linked to approval records

Undocumented disclosures are invalid.

## 13. OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT
Compliance with this policy is subject to:
- Research governance review
- Independent oversight audit
- Corrective or disciplinary action

Violations may result in disclosure suspension.

## 14. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT
This policy aligns with:
- EU AI Act transparency and performance disclosure requirements
- FDA GMLP communication expectations
- ISO/IEC 23894 AI risk communication principles
- Responsible AI disclosure standards
