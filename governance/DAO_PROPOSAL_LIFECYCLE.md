# DAO_PROPOSAL_LIFECYCLE.md
**Formal Governance Proposal Lifecycle Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory lifecycle stages** for all DAO proposals within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Ensure structured, auditable decision-making
- Prevent rushed or opaque governance actions
- Embed safety, ethics, and compliance checks
- Align DAO activity with regulatory-grade expectations

The proposal lifecycle is treated as a **governance safety mechanism**, not a procedural formality.

---

## 2. Scope

This lifecycle applies to:
- Governance proposals
- Funding proposals
- Registry and dataset proposals
- Model approval, suspension, or retirement proposals
- Emergency and non-emergency DAO actions

It applies across **Core**, **MedIntel**, and **DeSci** domains, with enforcement anchored in **DeSci governance**.

---

## 3. Lifecycle Stages (Overview)

Every proposal must pass through the following stages, in order:

1. Ideation & Pre-Check  
2. Formal Submission  
3. Classification & Risk Tagging  
4. Review & Deliberation  
5. Voting  
6. Execution  
7. Post-Decision Audit  
8. Archival & Reporting  

Skipping stages is prohibited except under formally declared emergency protocols.

---

## 4. Stage 1: Ideation & Pre-Check

Requirements:
- Clear problem statement
- Defined scope and intent
- Identification of affected domains (clinical, technical, governance)

Pre-check validation includes:
- Duplicate proposal detection
- Scope appropriateness
- Eligibility of proposer

Non-compliant proposals are rejected at this stage.

---

## 5. Stage 2: Formal Submission

Mandatory submission elements:
- Unique proposal identifier
- Proposer identity (pseudonymous allowed)
- Proposal category
- Detailed description
- Intended outcomes
- Impacted systems or policies

All submissions are timestamped and immutably recorded.

---

## 6. Stage 3: Classification & Risk Tagging

Each proposal is tagged with:
- Proposal type (governance, funding, clinical, research)
- Risk level (low, moderate, high, critical)
- Safety relevance flag
- Compliance relevance flag

High-risk and safety-relevant proposals trigger **mandatory expert review**.

---

## 7. Stage 4: Review & Deliberation

Review may include:
- Community discussion
- Expert committee analysis
- Ethics and compliance review
- Safety impact assessment

Minimum deliberation windows are enforced:
- Standard proposals: ≥ 7 days
- High-risk proposals: ≥ 14 days
- Emergency proposals: per emergency protocol

All review inputs are logged.

---

## 8. Stage 5: Voting

Voting requirements:
- Defined voting window
- Quorum threshold
- Voting mechanism disclosure
- Weighting rules transparency

Emergency proposals may use accelerated voting but must meet quorum and documentation standards.

---

## 9. Stage 6: Execution

Upon approval:
- Execution authority is explicitly defined
- Execution steps are logged
- Smart contract actions are traceable
- Off-chain actions require confirmation records

No proposal may self-execute without authorization controls.

---

## 10. Stage 7: Post-Decision Audit

Mandatory audit elements:
- Verification of execution correctness
- Impact assessment
- Deviation detection
- Incident flagging (if applicable)

Failures trigger remediation or rollback proposals.

---

## 11. Stage 8: Archival & Reporting

All proposals are archived with:
- Final decision status
- Voting results
- Execution outcome
- Audit summary

Archived proposals remain publicly accessible for transparency.

---

## 12. Emergency Proposal Handling

Emergency proposals:
- Must declare emergency justification
- Are subject to post-hoc review
- Cannot bypass audit or reporting stages
- Trigger enhanced transparency obligations

Abuse of emergency pathways is sanctionable.

---

## 13. Enforcement & Non-Compliance

Violations of this lifecycle may result in:
- Proposal invalidation
- Execution suspension
- Governance sanctions
- Mandatory audits

Lifecycle compliance is enforced through procedural and technical controls.

---

## 14. Regulatory Alignment

This lifecycle aligns with:
- ISO 37000 governance standards
- EU AI Act governance expectations
- OECD digital governance principles
- FDA governance traceability norms
- Open DAO best practices

---

## 15. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory for all DAO activity
- Binding across NeuroGrid governance layers
- Amendable only via compliant DAO process
- Subject to independent oversight
