# INDEPENDENT_OVERSIGHT_CHARTER.md  
**External Accountability & Safeguard Authority Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This Charter establishes the **Independent Oversight Function (IOF)** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to provide:
- External accountability
- Regulatory credibility
- Ethical independence
- Protection against governance capture
- Safeguards for patients, clinicians, contributors, and the public

Independent Oversight is treated as a **non-negotiable safety and compliance control**, not an optional advisory body.

---

## 2. Scope

The Independent Oversight Function applies across:

- NeuroGrid Core smart contracts
- MedIntel clinical AI systems
- DeSci registries and funding mechanisms
- DAO governance and voting processes
- RPM and post-operative monitoring workflows
- Bio-cybernetic device governance
- Emergency and override actions

It has jurisdiction over **technical, ethical, clinical, and governance domains**.

---

## 3. Independence Principles

The IOF operates under the following principles:

1. **Structural Independence** – No operational or financial dependency on DAO leadership  
2. **Decision Autonomy** – Authority cannot be overridden by DAO vote  
3. **Conflict-Free Composition** – No material conflicts of interest  
4. **Transparency** – Actions and findings are publicly disclosed (non-PII)  
5. **Regulatory Alignment** – Designed to satisfy global regulator expectations  

---

## 4. Oversight Authority

The IOF is empowered to:

- Review governance decisions
- Audit funding allocations
- Inspect registry approvals
- Review AI model lifecycle controls
- Examine RPM alert logic and escalation
- Investigate incidents and near-misses
- Evaluate emergency overrides
- Trigger corrective actions

It **cannot deploy, operate, or monetize systems**.

---

## 5. Mandatory Review Triggers

Independent Oversight review is mandatory for:

- Emergency model overrides
- AI model suspension or retirement
- Governance safety trigger activations
- Clinical adverse events
- RPM alert system changes
- Bio-cybernetic risk escalations
- DAO governance failures
- Cross-border regulatory incidents

---

## 6. Composition Requirements

The IOF must include representation from:

- Clinical medicine
- Medical ethics
- AI safety and governance
- Regulatory affairs
- Data protection and privacy
- Systems engineering

Minimum requirements:
- Odd-numbered membership
- Fixed, staggered terms
- Public credentials (non-sensitive)
- Jurisdictional diversity

---

## 7. Conflict of Interest Controls

Oversight members **must not**:
- Hold DAO executive roles
- Receive performance-linked compensation
- Vote on proposals they advised on
- Participate in funded projects they review

All conflicts must be disclosed and logged.

---

## 8. Oversight Actions & Powers

The IOF may:

- Issue binding safety recommendations
- Require remediation plans
- Suspend governance actions
- Escalate matters to regulators
- Trigger independent audits
- Require public disclosures
- Initiate post-market surveillance reviews

Failure to comply constitutes a **governance violation**.

---

## 9. Transparency & Reporting

The following must be publicly disclosed:
- Oversight findings (summary level)
- Safety interventions
- Governance failure notices
- Compliance determinations
- Audit outcomes

Patient data and sensitive IP are excluded.

---

## 10. Interaction with DAO Governance

- IOF decisions **supersede DAO votes** on safety, ethics, and compliance
- DAO proposals conflicting with IOF rulings are invalid
- Governance changes affecting oversight require IOF approval

Oversight is designed as a **hard constraint**, not a soft check.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment

This Charter aligns with:

- EU AI Act (independent oversight requirements)
- FDA SaMD post-market expectations
- OECD AI governance principles
- ISO 14971 (risk management)
- WHO guidance on AI in healthcare
- Global RPM and medical device frameworks

---

## 12. Amendment Rules

This Charter may only be amended:
- Through a supermajority DAO vote
- With Independent Oversight approval
- After public consultation
- With documented regulatory impact analysis

No emergency or fast-track amendments are permitted.

---

## 13. Ethical Position

> **Oversight exists to protect those without power, not to reassure those with it.**

Independent review is foundational to trust in clinical AI and decentralized science.

---

## 14. Binding Status

This Charter is:
- Binding across all NeuroGrid entities
- Enforced through governance and technical controls
- Subject to external audit
- Effective immediately upon adoption

---
