# DAO_VOTING_SAFETY_CONSTRAINTS.md  
**Non-Overrideable Safety & Clinical Protection Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **hard safety constraints** on DAO voting within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that **no DAO vote**, regardless of quorum, token weight, or urgency, can compromise:
- Patient safety
- Clinical integrity
- AI risk controls
- Regulatory compliance
- Ethical obligations

DAO governance governs **process and resources**, not **medical or safety outcomes**.

---

## 2. Foundational Rule

> **DAO voting authority is structurally and legally subordinate to safety, clinical, ethical, and regulatory requirements.**

No vote may override these domains.

---

## 3. Domains Explicitly Excluded from DAO Voting

DAO voting **must not** be used to decide or influence:

### 3.1 Clinical & Medical Decisions
- Treatment recommendations
- Post-operative care thresholds
- RPM alert severity or escalation
- Intervention timing

### 3.2 Safety Systems
- Disabling alerts or monitoring
- Suppressing adverse event reports
- Delaying emergency responses
- Modifying safety thresholds

### 3.3 AI & Model Controls
- Forcing model deployment
- Preventing model rollback or retirement
- Overriding drift or bias detection
- Altering validation criteria

### 3.4 Ethical Oversight
- Ethics committee determinations
- Human-subject protections
- Bio-cybernetic risk evaluations
- Consent requirements

### 3.5 Regulatory Obligations
- Reporting timelines
- Audit cooperation
- Compliance scope
- Jurisdictional adherence

---

## 4. Permitted DAO Voting Scope

DAO votes **may** govern:

- Funding allocation (non-clinical)
- Infrastructure investments
- Research grants (pre-approved scope)
- Governance process changes
- Non-safety operational priorities

All permitted votes remain subject to:
- Compliance validation
- Ethics review
- Safety veto authority

---

## 5. Safety Veto Mechanisms

### 5.1 Safety Council Veto
An independent Safety Council may unilaterally block any DAO vote that risks:
- Patient harm
- AI malfunction
- Regulatory breach

### 5.2 Emergency Override
In emergencies, predefined protocols automatically:
- Suspend voting effects
- Enforce safety actions
- Trigger disclosures

### 5.3 Ethics Committee Hold
Ethics committees may place a mandatory hold on:
- Votes affecting human subjects
- Bio-cybernetic systems
- Sensitive datasets

---

## 6. Technical Enforcement

Safety constraints are enforced through:

- Smart contract role separation
- Non-upgradable safety logic
- Immutable veto pathways
- On-chain audit logging
- Time-locked execution windows

Votes failing safety validation **cannot execute**, regardless of outcome.

---

## 7. Voting Validation Flow

1. Proposal submission
2. Automated safety classification
3. Compliance & ethics screening
4. DAO vote (if permitted)
5. Safety council validation
6. Execution or permanent rejection

---

## 8. Prohibited Voting Patterns

The following are strictly forbidden:

- Token-weighted clinical decisions
- Emergency votes replacing protocols
- Financial incentives tied to safety outcomes
- Majority votes overriding expert review

Any attempt triggers an incident review.

---

## 9. Violation Response

Violations result in:

1. Immediate proposal nullification
2. On-chain incident record
3. Suspension of proposer privileges
4. DAO sanctions vote
5. Regulatory notification if applicable

Severe cases may result in permanent governance exclusion.

---

## 10. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:

- EU AI Act (human oversight & risk controls)
- FDA GMLP principles
- ISO 14971 (risk management)
- WHO AI ethics guidelines
- Medical device governance standards

---

## 11. Ethical Position

> **Democracy governs communities.  
> Expertise governs medicine.  
> Safety governs all.**

DAO voting exists to enable coordination — never to replace responsibility.

---

## 12. Binding Status

This document is:
- Binding across all DAO mechanisms
- Superior to token-holder resolutions
- Enforced by smart contracts and councils
- Amendable only with safety and regulatory approval

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Governance Constraint**
