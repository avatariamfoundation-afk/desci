# DAO_SUCCESSION_PLANNING_FRAMEWORK
NeuroGrid-DeSci Governance Layer

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the mandatory succession planning framework for the NeuroGrid DAO. Its purpose is to ensure continuity of governance, regulatory integrity, ethical oversight, and operational stability in the event of leadership transition, incapacitation, resignation, removal, or emergency dissolution scenarios.

Succession planning is treated as a **governance-critical control**, not an optional best practice.

---

## 2. Scope
This framework applies to:
- Core DAO stewards
- Elected governance council members
- Independent oversight representatives
- Emergency multisig signatories
- Committee chairs (Ethics, Compliance, Research, Funding)

It explicitly excludes protocol contributors without governance authority.

---

## 3. Succession Triggers
Succession procedures are automatically or manually initiated under the following conditions:

### 3.1 Automatic Triggers
- Verified incapacity (medical or legal)
- Failure to perform duties for ≥ 60 consecutive days
- Breach resulting in permanent disqualification
- Loss of cryptographic access without recovery
- Death (verified through independent attestation)

### 3.2 Manual Triggers
- Voluntary resignation
- DAO vote of removal
- Emergency safety trigger invocation
- Regulatory mandate requiring leadership change

---

## 4. Role Classification
All governance roles are classified into succession tiers:

### Tier I — Critical Control Roles
- DAO Steward
- Treasury Custodian
- Emergency Override Signatory
- Compliance Lead

**Requirement:** Must have at least one pre-approved successor at all times.

### Tier II — Strategic Governance Roles
- Governance Council Member
- Ethics Committee Chair
- Research Oversight Lead

**Requirement:** Successor pool defined, final selection via DAO vote.

### Tier III — Operational Roles
- Working group coordinators
- Non-signatory committee members

**Requirement:** Temporary appointment permitted.

---

## 5. Successor Eligibility Criteria
A successor must:
- Be an active DAO member in good standing
- Have no unresolved conflicts of interest
- Pass compliance and ethics review
- Accept fiduciary and legal responsibility
- Acknowledge jurisdictional obligations (LGPD, HIPAA, GDPR where applicable)

Failure to meet any criterion invalidates candidacy.

---

## 6. Succession Mechanisms

### 6.1 Pre-Designated Succession
For Tier I roles, successors are nominated in advance and ratified annually by DAO vote.

Activation requires:
- Trigger verification
- Oversight committee confirmation
- On-chain execution

### 6.2 Emergency Interim Appointment
In emergency conditions:
- Independent Oversight Committee appoints an interim successor
- Maximum duration: 90 days
- Full DAO ratification required before expiration

### 6.3 Standard Election Process
For non-emergency transitions:
- Open nomination window (14 days)
- Disclosure and review period (7 days)
- On-chain vote with defined quorum and timelock
- Automatic role transfer upon execution

---

## 7. Cryptographic and Access Continuity
All Tier I roles must use:
- Multisig-controlled access
- Hardware-backed key custody
- Dead-man switch or key recovery protocol

No single individual may retain unilateral control post-transition.

---

## 8. Documentation and Audit Trail
All succession events must be:
- Logged on-chain
- Recorded in governance archives
- Reviewed by the Independent Oversight Committee
- Included in the annual governance audit

Failure to log a succession event constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 9. Regulatory and Ethical Safeguards
Succession decisions must not:
- Circumvent compliance obligations
- Obscure accountability
- Concentrate power
- Compromise patient safety or research integrity

Any such action triggers an automatic governance review.

---

## 10. Review and Amendment
This document:
- Is reviewed annually
- May only be amended via DAO proposal
- Requires supermajority approval
- Cannot be suspended, even in emergency mode

---

## 11. Binding Effect
This succession framework is binding across all NeuroGrid-DeSci governance operations and supersedes informal agreements, off-chain understandings, or legacy practices.

Non-compliance may result in immediate removal and sanction.
