# DAO_ROLE_ELIGIBILITY_AND_CONFLICTS.md  
**Role Eligibility, Independence & Conflict Management Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory eligibility criteria, role integrity requirements, and conflict-of-interest controls** governing all DAO roles within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Prevent governance capture
- Ensure independence of safety and ethics functions
- Eliminate undisclosed conflicts of interest
- Protect clinical, scientific, and regulatory trust
- Enforce role-based accountability

Role eligibility is treated as a **systemic safety and governance control**, not a reputational preference.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all individuals occupying or seeking to occupy roles within:

- NeuroGrid DAO governance
- Safety councils
- Ethics committees
- Funding and treasury oversight bodies
- Registry and review committees
- Emergency authority holders

It applies across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci layers**.

---

## 3. Role Classification

DAO roles are classified as follows:

### 3.1 Governance Roles
- DAO delegates
- Voting representatives
- Proposal sponsors
- Committee chairs

### 3.2 Safety & Ethics Roles
- Clinical safety council members
- Ethics review board members
- Risk and compliance officers
- Emergency override authorities

### 3.3 Operational Roles
- Registry maintainers
- Model reviewers
- Funding allocators
- Infrastructure stewards

Each role carries **distinct eligibility and conflict constraints**.

---

## 4. General Eligibility Requirements

All role candidates must:

- Demonstrate relevant domain competence
- Complete governance onboarding
- Accept binding compliance obligations
- Disclose all relevant interests
- Agree to audit and transparency requirements
- Pass conflict-of-interest review

Failure to meet eligibility criteria disqualifies role assignment.

---

## 5. Mandatory Conflict of Interest Disclosure

Prior to role assignment, candidates must disclose:

- Financial interests
- Token holdings exceeding defined thresholds
- Employment or advisory relationships
- Research sponsorships
- Equity or IP ownership
- Vendor or contractor relationships
- Familial or close personal ties relevant to decisions

Disclosure is continuous, not one-time.

---

## 6. Prohibited Role Combinations

The following role overlaps are **explicitly prohibited**:

- Safety or ethics roles combined with funding allocation authority
- Emergency override authority combined with treasury control
- Registry approval roles combined with dataset or model submission
- Ethics review roles combined with commercial exploitation of reviewed assets
- Compliance oversight combined with governance proposal authorship on related matters

Structural separation is mandatory.

---

## 7. Token Influence Constraints

To prevent governance capture:

- High token holders are restricted from safety-critical roles
- Token voting weight may be capped for certain role classes
- Token holdings must be disclosed for all governance positions
- Safety and ethics roles may not be token-incentivized

Governance authority is not proportional to capital.

---

## 8. Conflict Review & Determination Process

All disclosed conflicts undergo:

1. Independent review
2. Risk and materiality assessment
3. Mitigation determination
4. Role eligibility decision
5. Documentation and audit logging

Conflicts may result in:
- Conditional role approval
- Recusal requirements
- Role restriction
- Full disqualification

---

## 9. Ongoing Monitoring & Recusal

Role holders must:
- Update disclosures upon material change
- Recuse themselves from conflicted decisions
- Accept monitoring and audit review

Failure to recuse constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 10. Enforcement & Sanctions

Violations of eligibility or conflict rules may result in:

- Immediate role suspension
- Role removal
- Governance sanctions
- Funding revocation
- Public disclosure where safety-relevant

Sanctions follow the DAO Sanctions & Remediation Framework.

---

## 11. Transparency Requirements

The following are publicly disclosed:
- Role classifications
- Eligibility criteria
- Conflict review outcomes (non-sensitive)
- Recusal events
- Role removals for conflict violations

Sensitive personal data is never disclosed.

---

## 12. Regulatory & Ethical Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- OECD governance principles
- EU AI Act governance safeguards
- Clinical research independence standards
- ISO 37000 governance guidance
- Medical ethics conflict-of-interest norms

---

## 13. Review & Update Cycle

This policy is reviewed:
- Annually
- After major governance incidents
- Following regulatory changes
- Upon DAO structural revisions

---

## 14. Binding Status

This document is:
- Binding across all NeuroGrid DAOs
- Enforced through technical and procedural controls
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes
- Subject to internal and external audit
