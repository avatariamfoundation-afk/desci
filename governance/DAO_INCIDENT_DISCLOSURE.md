# DAO_INCIDENT_DISCLOSURE.md  
**Incident Transparency, Disclosure & Accountability Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how the NeuroGrid DAO identifies, documents, discloses, and governs **incidents** across clinical, technical, governance, and ethical domains.

Incident disclosure is a **non-negotiable obligation**, not a reputational choice.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all incidents involving:

- Smart contracts and on-chain governance
- AI/ML models and inference pipelines
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems
- Data integrity, privacy, or security
- Clinical decision support outputs
- DAO governance actions or failures
- Compliance or regulatory deviations

---

## 3. Definition of an Incident

An **incident** is any event that may:

- Harm or mislead patients, clinicians, or researchers
- Compromise data integrity or confidentiality
- Produce unsafe, incorrect, or biased outputs
- Violate regulatory, ethical, or governance obligations
- Undermine trust in the system or DAO

Incidents include **near-misses**, not only realized harm.

---

## 4. Incident Classification

### Level 1 – Informational
- No safety or compliance impact
- Logged internally
- No public disclosure required

### Level 2 – Minor
- Limited operational impact
- No patient harm
- Internal disclosure + governance record

### Level 3 – Major
- Potential safety, ethical, or compliance impact
- Time-bound disclosure required
- DAO oversight mandatory

### Level 4 – Critical
- Patient risk, regulatory breach, or systemic failure
- Immediate disclosure
- Emergency governance protocols triggered

---

## 5. Mandatory Disclosure Triggers

Disclosure is **mandatory** when an incident involves:

- Patient safety or clinical outcomes
- Data breaches or re-identification risk
- Model hallucination with clinical relevance
- Unauthorized governance actions
- Emergency overrides
- Regulatory reporting thresholds
- Repeated false positives or false negatives

Silence is considered governance failure.

---

## 6. Disclosure Timeline

| Incident Level | Disclosure Window |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Level 1        | Internal only     |
| Level 2        | ≤ 14 days         |
| Level 3        | ≤ 72 hours        |
| Level 4        | ≤ 24 hours        |

Timelines begin at **incident detection**, not confirmation.

---

## 7. Disclosure Channels

Depending on severity, disclosures may occur via:

- Public incident registry
- DAO governance portal
- Affected stakeholders (patients, researchers)
- Regulators and ethics boards
- Internal audit logs

Sensitive details may be redacted, but facts may not be obscured.

---

## 8. Disclosure Content Requirements

Each disclosed incident must include:

- Incident ID
- Date and time detected
- Affected systems or models
- Severity classification
- Known or potential impact
- Immediate mitigation steps
- Ongoing investigation status
- Planned corrective actions

Speculation is prohibited; uncertainty must be stated explicitly.

---

## 9. DAO Responsibilities

The DAO must:

- Ensure disclosures occur on time
- Prevent suppression or delay
- Allocate resources for remediation
- Approve corrective actions
- Preserve immutable records
- Review systemic lessons learned

Failure to disclose constitutes a governance breach.

---

## 10. Emergency Disclosure Authority

During critical incidents:

- Safety Council or Emergency Operators may disclose without prior DAO vote
- DAO must ratify actions post hoc
- Emergency disclosures override reputational considerations

---

## 11. Protection Against Retaliation

Individuals reporting incidents in good faith are protected from:

- Governance retaliation
- Funding exclusion
- Role removal
- Reputation-based penalties

Retaliation is itself a disclosable incident.

---

## 12. Incident Registry

All incidents are recorded in an **immutable incident registry** containing:

- Full disclosure history
- Status updates
- Resolution confirmation
- Audit references

Resolved incidents remain publicly accessible.

---

## 13. Post-Incident Review

For Level 3 and 4 incidents, a formal review is mandatory:

- Root cause analysis
- Governance process evaluation
- Model or system correction
- Policy updates if required

Reviews are summarized and disclosed.

---

## 14. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:

- FDA adverse event reporting expectations
- EU MDR / IVDR vigilance systems
- EU AI Act incident transparency
- ISO 27001 & 27701 breach disclosure
- WHO AI ethics guidance

---

## 15. Ethical Position

> **Trust is not preserved by silence.  
> It is preserved by timely truth.**

Incident disclosure is an ethical duty owed to patients, contributors, and society.

---

### Status
**Active – Binding Governance and Compliance Instrument**
