# TOKEN_ECONOMIC_NON_INTERFERENCE.md  
**Clinical, Scientific & Safety Independence Policy**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes a strict separation between **token economics** and **clinical, scientific, and safety decision-making** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Patient safety is never influenced by financial incentives
- Scientific integrity is preserved
- Regulatory trust is maintained
- DAO governance cannot be financially captured

Tokens may govern **process**, never **outcomes**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **No token-based mechanism may influence, distort, delay, suppress, or override clinical, safety, or scientific decisions.**

This principle is absolute and non-negotiable.

---

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Governance tokens
- Utility tokens
- Funding or incentive tokens
- Delegated voting power
- Token-weighted DAO mechanisms

Across all domains including:
- Post-operative monitoring (RPM)
- Bio-cybernetic systems
- AI model governance
- Dataset inclusion or exclusion
- Safety alerts and escalation
- Regulatory disclosures

---

## 4. Prohibited Token Interference

Token mechanisms **must not** be used to:

### 4.1 Clinical Decisions
- Approve or reject treatment pathways
- Delay adverse event reporting
- Suppress RPM alerts
- Influence clinical thresholds

### 4.2 AI & Model Governance
- Force model deployment
- Delay model retirement
- Override drift or safety flags
- Alter model evaluation criteria

### 4.3 Scientific Integrity
- Manipulate research outcomes
- Favor datasets for financial reasons
- Suppress negative results
- Control attribution unfairly

### 4.4 Regulatory Compliance
- Vote against mandatory disclosures
- Delay compliance actions
- Bypass legal obligations
- Obstruct audits or inspections

---

## 5. Permitted Token Functions

Tokens **may** be used for:

- Governance process participation
- Budget allocation for approved domains
- Infrastructure funding decisions
- DAO operational coordination
- Non-clinical prioritization

Tokens **do not** confer authority over:
- Medical judgment
- Safety decisions
- Ethical determinations
- Legal obligations

---

## 6. Separation of Authority

| Domain                     | Token Influence Allowed |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Clinical Decisions        | ❌ No |
| Safety Alerts             | ❌ No |
| AI Risk Controls          | ❌ No |
| Ethics Determinations     | ❌ No |
| Regulatory Actions        | ❌ No |
| Budget Allocation         | ✅ Yes |
| Infrastructure Funding   | ✅ Yes |
| Governance Procedures    | ✅ Yes |

---

## 7. Safeguards & Controls

### 7.1 Structural Safeguards
- Safety Council veto authority
- Ethics Committee independence
- Emergency override mechanisms
- Mandatory compliance pathways

### 7.2 Technical Safeguards
- Hard-coded non-override logic
- Separation of smart contract roles
- Immutable safety triggers
- Audit-locked decision paths

### 7.3 Governance Safeguards
- Conflict-of-interest disclosure
- Token-blind safety reviews
- Supermajority requirements for funding
- External audit checkpoints

---

## 8. Violation Handling

Any attempt at token-based interference triggers:

1. Immediate investigation
2. Temporary suspension of involved parties
3. On-chain incident record
4. DAO vote for sanctions
5. Regulatory disclosure if required

Repeated or severe violations may result in:
- Governance removal
- Permanent DAO exclusion
- Legal escalation

---

## 9. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:

- EU AI Act (risk governance & human oversight)
- FDA Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP)
- WHO AI ethics guidelines
- OECD AI principles
- Medical device post-market surveillance standards

---

## 10. Ethical Position

> **Markets optimize value.  
> Medicine protects life.  
> Science pursues truth.  
> These domains must never be merged.**

---

## 11. Binding Status

This document is:
- Binding across all DAO operations
- Enforceable through governance
- Superior to token-holder resolutions
- Immutable without regulatory-safe amendment

---
