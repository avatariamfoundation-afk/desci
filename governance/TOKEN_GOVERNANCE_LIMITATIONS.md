**Safeguards Against Token Capture, Abuse, and Clinical Risk**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines strict **limitations on token-based governance** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objective is to ensure that **tokens cannot be used to override clinical safety, ethical obligations, regulatory compliance, or emergency protections**, particularly in systems involving:

- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- Post-operative care
- Bio-cybernetic and subcutaneous medical devices
- AI-driven clinical decision support

Tokens are a **coordination mechanism**, not a source of absolute authority.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **No financial instrument may supersede patient safety, medical ethics, or law.**

Token ownership **does not equal control** over safety-critical decisions.

---

## 3. Scope of Token Governance

Tokens may be used for:

- Funding allocation decisions
- Research prioritization
- Non-clinical system parameters
- DAO participation and signaling
- Incentive alignment for contributors

Tokens may **not** be used for direct or indirect clinical control.

---

## 4. Explicit Governance Prohibitions

Token holders **cannot vote on or influence**:

- Clinical thresholds or alert parameters
- AI model behavior affecting patient outcomes
- Emergency safety actions
- Ethics review decisions
- Regulatory compliance obligations
- Post-market surveillance outcomes
- Device activation, deactivation, or override logic

These domains are **non-token-governable by design**.

---

## 5. Anti-Whale & Anti-Capture Controls

To prevent governance capture:

- No single address may control more than a capped voting percentage
- Quadratic or reputation-weighted voting is enforced
- Time-locks apply to high-impact decisions
- Delegation transparency is mandatory

Economic power cannot translate into medical authority.

---

## 6. Separation of Powers Model

NeuroGrid governance operates under **separation of domains**:

| Domain | Governed By |
|------|------------|
| Clinical Safety | Independent Clinical Authorities |
| Ethics | Ethics Review Council |
| Emergency Response | Emergency Oversight Council |
| Compliance | Regulatory & Legal Mandates |
| Funding | Token-Governed DAO |
| Research Direction | Hybrid DAO + Expert Panels |

Tokens govern **funding and direction**, not execution or safety.

---

## 7. Emergency Override Supremacy

During declared emergencies:

- Token voting is automatically suspended for affected domains
- Emergency actions override all token outcomes
- Post-emergency review invalidates any conflicting token decisions

Tokens **cannot block or delay safety actions**.

---

## 8. Regulatory Alignment

These limitations ensure compliance with:

- EU MDR & IVDR governance expectations
- FDA Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) guidance
- WHO AI ethics frameworks
- OECD AI accountability standards
- Global post-market surveillance requirements

Any token mechanism conflicting with law is **null and void**.

---

## 9. Transparency & Auditability

All token-governed decisions must be:

- Publicly recorded
- Auditable
- Timestamped
- Linked to scope limitations

Any vote exceeding permitted scope is automatically rejected.

---

## 10. Enforcement & Sanctions

Violations may result in:

- Vote invalidation
- Token slashing (where applicable)
- Governance suspension
- Permanent disqualification from DAO participation
- Legal escalation if patient risk is involved

---

## 11. Ethical Position

> **Markets optimize incentives.  
> Medicine protects life.  
> One must never govern the other.**

---

## 12. Review & Amendment

This document is reviewed:

- Annually
- After governance incidents
- Following regulatory changes

Amendments require:
- Ethics approval
- Compliance review
- Full DAO ratification

---

### Status
**Active – Binding Governance Limitation**

Applies to all NeuroGrid tokens, DAOs, contributors, and affiliated systems.
