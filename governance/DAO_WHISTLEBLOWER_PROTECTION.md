**Protected Disclosure & Non-Retaliation Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **Whistleblower Protection Framework** for the NeuroGrid DAO.

Its objectives are to:
- Encourage early reporting of risks and misconduct
- Protect individuals who raise concerns in good faith
- Strengthen ethical governance and system resilience
- Ensure regulatory credibility across global jurisdictions

Whistleblowing is treated as a **system safeguard**, not dissent.

---

## 2. Governance Principle

> **Silence is the most dangerous failure mode in decentralized systems.**

Protection of whistleblowers is mandatory to prevent:
- Governance capture
- Ethical erosion
- Patient harm
- Regulatory failure

---

## 3. Scope of Protection

Protection applies to:
- DAO members
- Contributors
- Researchers
- Developers
- Reviewers
- Contractors
- Delegates
- Anonymous reporters

Protection is independent of role or voting power.

---

## 4. Reportable Matters

Whistleblowers may report:
- Ethical violations
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Data misuse or leakage
- AI model risks or failures
- RPM safety concerns
- Governance manipulation
- Financial misconduct
- Conflicts of interest
- Security vulnerabilities
- Patient safety threats

Both actual and suspected issues are covered.

---

## 5. Good Faith Standard

A report is protected if:
- Made honestly
- Based on reasonable belief
- Not knowingly false or malicious

Proof is **not required** to initiate protection.

---

## 6. Reporting Channels

### 6.1 Approved Channels
- Anonymous DAO reporting interface
- Ethics committee submission
- Secure encrypted inbox
- Governance proposal (if safe)

### 6.2 Emergency Channel
Used when:
- Patient safety is at immediate risk
- Active system harm is occurring

---

## 7. Anonymity & Confidentiality

- Anonymous reporting is permitted and protected
- Identity disclosure is voluntary
- Access to identity (if known) is strictly limited
- Metadata minimization is enforced

Re-identification attempts are sanctionable.

---

## 8. Anti-Retaliation Guarantee

Retaliation is strictly prohibited, including:
- Role removal
- Funding denial
- Reputation attacks
- Governance exclusion
- Legal threats
- Harassment
- Subtle coercion or pressure

Retaliation triggers **automatic sanctions**.

---

## 9. Retaliation Response

If retaliation is suspected:
1. Immediate protective measures applied
2. Investigation initiated
3. Enforcement actions escalated
4. Public disclosure if required

Intent is irrelevant; impact governs response.

---

## 10. Review & Investigation Process

- Independent review body assigned
- Conflict-of-interest screening applied
- Evidence handled securely
- Findings documented
- Actions time-bound

Investigations prioritize safety over speed.

---

## 11. Whistleblower Support Measures

Protections may include:
- Temporary role shielding
- Funding continuity
- Governance participation protection
- Legal referral (if applicable)

Support is proportional to risk exposure.

---

## 12. False Reporting Safeguards

Knowingly malicious or fraudulent reports:
- Are not protected
- May trigger sanctions
- Require clear evidence of intent

Good-faith errors remain protected.

---

## 13. Regulatory Coordination

- Whistleblower identity protected where legally possible
- DAO cooperation is mandatory

---

## 14. Transparency & Disclosure
