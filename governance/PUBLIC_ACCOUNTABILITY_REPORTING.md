**Public Accountability & Transparency Reporting Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **Public Accountability Reporting Framework** for the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Governance actions are publicly accountable
- Stakeholders can evaluate decision integrity
- Transparency is proactive, structured, and verifiable
- Disclosure obligations are met without compromising safety, privacy, or security

Public accountability is treated as a **foundational trust mechanism**, not a marketing exercise.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all public-facing accountability disclosures related to:
- DAO governance decisions
- AI model governance
- Dataset and research registry actions
- Funding flows and allocations
- Ethics and compliance outcomes
- Incident disclosures
- System performance metrics (non-sensitive)

It spans **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci** layers.

---

## 3. Accountability Principles

All public reporting must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Accuracy** – Factually correct and verifiable  
2. **Completeness** – Sufficient context for interpretation  
3. **Timeliness** – Disclosed within defined time windows  
4. **Proportionality** – Appropriate level of detail  
5. **Non-Deception** – No misleading omissions or framing  
6. **Safety-Aware Transparency** – No disclosure that creates harm  

---

## 4. Public Accountability Artifacts

The following artifacts constitute the public accountability surface:

| Artifact | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Governance Summaries | High-level decision disclosures |
| Transparency Metrics | Quantitative governance indicators |
| Incident Reports | Public incident disclosures |
| Audit Summaries | Non-sensitive audit outcomes |
| Ethics Statements | Ethics review conclusions |
| Funding Disclosures | Aggregate funding transparency |

Raw internal data is excluded unless legally required.

---

## 5. Disclosure Categories

- Proprietary architectures
- Security-sensitive parameters

---

### 5.3 Dataset & Research Registry Disclosures

- Governance conditions
- Ethical clearance status

Personal data and raw datasets are excluded.

---

### 5.4 Funding & Resource Allocation Disclosures
Publicly reported:

---

### 5.5 Ethics & Compliance Disclosures

---

## 6. Incident & Adverse Event Reporting

Public incident disclosures must include:
- Incident classification

- High-level impact
- Mitigation actions
- Status (open / resolved)

Incident disclosure timelines are governed by:
- Severity
- Regulatory obligations
- Patient safety considerations

---

## 7. Reporting Frequency

| Report Type | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|
| Governance Summary | Continuous / Event-driven |
| Transparency Metrics | Quarterly |
| Ethics Statement | Quarterly |
| Funding Disclosure | Quarterly |
| Audit Summary | Annual |
| Incident Disclosure | Event-driven |

Emergency disclosures override standard schedules.

---

## 8. Transparency Metrics

Public metrics may include:
- Number of governance proposals
- Approval vs rejection rates
- Average decision time
- Emergency actions invoked
- Ethics reviews conducted
- Model changes approved

Metrics are aggregated and anonymized.

---

## 9. Disclosure Channels

Public accountability reports may be published via:
- Official project repositories
- Governance dashboards
- Public transparency portals
- Regulatory disclosure channels

All disclosures must be timestamped and versioned.

---

## 10. Redaction & Withholding Rules

Information may be withheld or redacted if disclosure would:
- Endanger patients or participants
- Compromise system security
- Violate privacy regulations
- Breach contractual obligations
- Enable adversarial exploitation

All redactions must be justified and logged.

---

## 11. Corrections & Amendments

If a disclosure is found to be inaccurate:
- A corrected disclosure must be issued
- The original version remains archived
- The correction rationale is documented

Silent revisions are prohibited.

---

## 12. Oversight & Accountability

Public accountability reporting is overseen by:
- DAO governance bodies
- Ethics oversight mechanisms
- Compliance authorities
- External auditors (where applicable)

Failure to disclose when required constitutes a **governance breach**.

---

## 13. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- EU AI Act transparency obligations
- ISO/IEC 42001 accountability principles
- OECD AI governance guidelines
- FDA post-market transparency concepts
- LGPD/GDPR public disclosure constraints

---

## 14. Ethical Position

> **Transparency is not total visibility — it is responsible disclosure.**

Public accountability exists to inform, not to expose or endanger.

---

## 15. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory for public-facing disclosures
- Enforceable through governance controls
- Subject to periodic review
- Amendable only via compliant DAO procedures
