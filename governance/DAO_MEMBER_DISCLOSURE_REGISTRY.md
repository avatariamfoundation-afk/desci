**Governance Disclosure, Transparency & Conflict Registry**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **DAO Member Disclosure Registry** for the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Ensure transparency of governance participants
- Identify and manage conflicts of interest
- Protect clinical, scientific, and funding integrity
- Support regulatory and audit requirements

Member disclosure is treated as a **governance safety and trust mechanism**, not an optional courtesy.

---

## 2. Scope

This registry applies to:
- DAO members with voting rights
- Proposal authors
- Delegates and representatives
- Committee and council members
- Emergency and override authority holders

It applies across **Core**, **MedIntel**, and **DeSci** governance layers.

---

## 3. Disclosure Principles

All disclosures must follow these principles:

1. **Accuracy** – Information must be truthful and current  
2. **Materiality** – Relevant interests must be disclosed  
3. **Timeliness** – Updates must be prompt  
4. **Proportionality** – No unnecessary personal data  
5. **Auditability** – Disclosures must be reviewable  

Pseudonymity is permitted, anonymity is not.

---

## 4. Required Disclosure Categories

Each covered participant must disclose, at minimum:

### 4.1 Identity Declaration
- Pseudonymous DAO identifier
- Governance roles held
- Delegations received or granted

### 4.2 Financial Interests
- Token holdings exceeding governance thresholds
- Equity or financial stakes in related entities
- Funding recipient status within NeuroGrid

### 4.3 Professional Affiliations
- Employment or advisory roles
- Research sponsorships
- Clinical or institutional affiliations

### 4.4 Governance Conflicts
- Direct involvement in proposals under vote
- Authority overlap with safety or compliance functions
- Any position that could bias decision-making

---

## 5. Disclosure Update Requirements

Disclosures must be updated:
- Upon role assignment or removal
- Prior to submitting a proposal
- Prior to voting where conflicts exist
- Within 7 days of any material change

Outdated disclosures are treated as non-compliance.

---

## 6. Conflict Handling Rules

When a conflict is disclosed:
- Automatic flagging is triggered
- Recusal requirements are evaluated
- Voting or authority limitations may apply
- Oversight review may be initiated

Failure to comply with recusal rules is a governance violation.

---

## 7. Registry Visibility

The registry maintains:
- Publicly visible summary disclosures
- Restricted-access sensitive details
- Immutable disclosure history
- Time-stamped updates

Patient-identifiable or sensitive personal data is never stored.

---

## 8. Verification & Audit

Disclosures are subject to:
- Random audits
- Triggered reviews during disputes
- Oversight committee verification
- External audit where required

False or misleading disclosures trigger enforcement actions.

---

## 9. Enforcement Actions

Non-compliance may result in:
- Disclosure correction orders
- Temporary voting suspension
- Proposal invalidation
- Role removal
- DAO sanctions or expulsion

Severity is proportional to risk and intent.

---

## 10. Whistleblower Protection

Members reporting undisclosed conflicts are protected under:
- Non-retaliation guarantees
- Confidential handling
- Independent oversight review

Retaliation is a major governance violation.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment

This registry aligns with:
- ISO 37000 governance standards
- OECD conflict-of-interest principles
- EU AI Act governance transparency expectations
- Medical research ethics requirements

---

## 12. Ethical Position

> **Trust requires disclosure before power is exercised.**

Hidden interests are incompatible with clinical-grade governance.

---

## 13. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory for covered participants
- Enforced through governance controls
- Subject to audit and oversight
- Amendable only via approved DAO process
