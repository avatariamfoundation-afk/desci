**Conflict, Interest & Accountability Transparency Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory disclosure framework** for all stakeholders participating in the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objective is to:
- Prevent conflicts of interest
- Preserve clinical and scientific integrity
- Ensure regulatory defensibility
- Maintain trust across decentralized governance structures

Non-disclosure is treated as a **material governance violation**.

---

## 2. Scope

This matrix applies to all individuals and entities with any of the following roles:

- DAO governance participants
- Clinical experts and reviewers
- AI model developers and maintainers
- Researchers and data contributors
- Funding recipients
- Infrastructure operators

Disclosure obligations apply **before participation** and on an **ongoing basis**.

---

## 3. Disclosure Philosophy

NeuroGrid operates under the principle of **Asymmetric Risk Awareness**:

> Those closest to decision-making power carry the highest disclosure burden.

Transparency is not optional in clinical-grade decentralized systems.

Failure to disclose where required results in **automatic restriction**.

---

## 7. Disclosure Timing

Disclosures must be:
- Submitted prior to role activation
- Updated upon material change
- Reconfirmed annually at minimum

Expired disclosures invalidate voting or approval rights.

---

## 8. Review & Verification

- Disclosures are reviewed by the Compliance & Ethics function
- Spot audits may be conducted
- False disclosure constitutes a governance breach

Automated checks may supplement human review.

---

## 9. Conflict Handling

When a material conflict is identified:
- The stakeholder may comment
- The stakeholder may not vote or approve
- Recusal is mandatory for affected decisions

Conflict status is logged immutably.

---

## 10. Transparency & Access

- Disclosure summaries are visible to the DAO
- Sensitive details may be access-controlled
- Regulators may be granted full visibility upon request

Privacy does not override safety or compliance.

---

## 11. Enforcement & Sanctions

Violations may result in:
- Suspension of governance rights
- Removal from role
- Funding clawback
- Registry delisting
- Permanent exclusion in severe cases

Sanctions scale with risk exposure.

---

## 12. Recordkeeping

All disclosures are:
- Timestamped
- Versioned
- Retained indefinitely
- Linked to governance actions

Records form part of the permanent compliance archive.

---

## 13. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- FDA conflict-of-interest guidance
- EU AI Act transparency expectations
- ISO 37001 (Anti-Bribery)
- ISO 37301 (Compliance Management)
- WHO ethics governance standards

---

## 14. Ethical Position

> **Hidden incentives corrode truth.  
> Undeclared bias endangers patients.**

Disclosure is not a burden — it is a safeguard.
