# GOVERNANCE_RECORD_RETENTION_POLICY.md
**Governance Data Preservation & Retention Standard**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory record retention policy** for all governance-related activities within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- Long-term accountability of governance decisions
- Regulatory-grade auditability
- Legal defensibility of DAO actions
- Prevention of historical data manipulation or erasure

Governance records are treated as **critical infrastructure assets**, not administrative artifacts.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all records generated by:
- DAO proposals and voting
- Governance deliberations and outcomes
- Emergency actions and overrides
- Ethics and compliance interventions
- Funding approvals and sanctions
- Registry and policy changes

It applies across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci governance layers**.

---

## 3. Record Categories

Governance records are classified as follows:

### 3.1 Permanent Records
Retained indefinitely:
- DAO proposals and outcomes
- Voting results and quorum data
- Emergency safety actions
- Sanctions and remediation decisions
- Ethics committee determinations
- Governance charter amendments

### 3.2 Long-Term Records
Retained for a minimum of **10 years**:
- Governance deliberation logs
- Funding allocation records
- Committee membership histories
- Conflict of interest disclosures
- Incident response governance actions

### 3.3 Limited-Term Records
Retained for **3–5 years** unless escalated:
- Procedural logs
- Non-decisional communications
- Draft proposals not submitted
- Informational notices

---

## 4. Retention Principles

All governance records must meet the following principles:

1. **Immutability** – Records cannot be altered after finalization  
2. **Traceability** – Records must be attributable to actions  
3. **Durability** – Records must survive system upgrades  
4. **Availability** – Records must be retrievable for audits  
5. **Non-Repudiation** – Actions cannot be denied after recording  

---

## 5. Storage & Format Requirements

Governance records must be:
- Stored in tamper-resistant systems
- Backed by cryptographic integrity checks
- Time-stamped using verifiable sources
- Exportable in regulator-readable formats

Where applicable:
- On-chain events are considered primary records
- Off-chain records must reference immutable identifiers

---

## 6. Access Control

Access to governance records is governed by:
- Role-based permissions
- Audit-only read access for regulators
- Public access to non-sensitive summaries
- Restricted access for sensitive deliberations

No record may be deleted due to:
- Reputational concerns
- Political pressure
- Governance transitions
- Token-holder influence

---

## 7. Prohibited Actions

The following are strictly prohibited:
- Retroactive modification of records
- Selective deletion or concealment
- Informal off-record governance decisions
- Record destruction to avoid scrutiny
- Shadow governance channels

Violations trigger compliance escalation.

---

## 8. Archival & Migration

When systems evolve:
- Records must be migrated without loss
- Original hashes and identifiers must be preserved
- Migration logs must be created and audited

Archived records remain subject to audit.

---

## 9. Incident & Breach Handling

If governance records are compromised:
- Immediate containment is required
- Incident classification is triggered
- Independent oversight review is mandatory
- Public disclosure occurs where required

Record loss is treated as a **critical governance failure**.

---

## 10. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- EU AI Act governance traceability requirements
- ISO 37000 governance standards
- ISO 27001 record integrity controls
- FDA and EMA audit expectations
- Open governance best practices

---

## 11. Ethical Position

> **Governance legitimacy depends on memory.  
> What cannot be remembered cannot be trusted.**

Record retention is foundational to institutional integrity.

---

## 12. Binding Status

This policy is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid governance bodies
- Enforced through technical and procedural controls
- Subject to independent audit
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes
