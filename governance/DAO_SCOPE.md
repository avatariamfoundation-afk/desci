**NeuroGrid DAO – Governance Scope & Authority Definition**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the scope, authority, and limitations of the NeuroGrid Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

The DAO exists to:
- Govern the NeuroGrid DeSci Registry
- Safeguard scientific integrity
- Allocate funding responsibly
- Enforce ethical and compliance standards
- Enable decentralized yet accountable decision-making

The DAO is a **steward**, not an owner, of scientific knowledge.

## 2. Governance Philosophy

NeuroGrid governance is founded on five principles:

1. **Scientific Primacy** – Governance serves science, not speculation  
2. **Ethical Non-Negotiability** – Ethics override economic incentives  
3. **Transparency by Default** – Decisions are auditable and reasoned  
4. **Decentralized Accountability** – Authority is distributed, not absent  
5. **Long-Term Alignment** – Short-term gain must not compromise future trust
