Real-World Evidence Generation & Post-Deployment Validation Framework

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the Real-World Evidence (RWE) plan for NeuroGrid Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems.

Its purpose is to ensure that:

Deployed RPM systems generate clinically meaningful evidence

AI-supported insights are continuously validated in real-world use

Safety, performance, and equity are assessed beyond controlled datasets

Regulatory-grade evidence is produced without disrupting care delivery

RWE is a mandatory lifecycle obligation, not an optional research activity.

---

# 2. Scope

This plan applies to:

All RPM devices, sensors, and data pipelines

AI-assisted monitoring, alerting, and risk stratification models

Post-market surveillance activities

Registry-linked outcome tracking

It covers observational, longitudinal, and post-deployment evidence generation.

---

# 3. RWE Governance Principle

Clinical truth emerges in practice, not only in validation datasets.

Real-world data must be treated as a first-class safety and performance signal.

---

# 4. Evidence Objectives

RWE activities must support:

Verification of real-world safety and effectiveness

Detection of performance drift and failure modes

Assessment of population-specific impacts

Validation of confidence thresholds and alert logic

Regulatory reporting and audit readiness

Evidence generation must never compromise patient care or privacy.

---

# 5. Data Sources

Approved real-world data sources include:

RPM sensor telemetry

Clinician interaction logs

Alert acknowledgements and overrides

Outcome follow-ups (where available)

Adverse event reports

Patient-reported outcomes (if approved)

All data must comply with consent, privacy, and data minimization requirements.

---

# 6. Study Design Classes

RWE may be generated through:

A. Passive Observational Monitoring

No change to care pathways

Background performance tracking

B. Prospective Observational Cohorts

Defined inclusion criteria

Time-bound follow-up

C. Retrospective Analysis

De-identified historical RPM data

Registry-approved reuse only

Interventional studies require separate ethical and regulatory approval.

---

# 7. Key Evidence Metrics

RWE metrics may include:

Alert precision and recall

False positive / false negative rates

Time-to-clinical-action

Override frequency and rationale

Adverse event correlation

Outcome concordance with standard care

Metrics must be clinically interpretable and risk-focused.

---

# 8. Population & Bias Surveillance

RWE analysis must explicitly assess:

Demographic subgroup performance

Device variability effects

Environmental and contextual factors

Data completeness and quality disparities

Identified biases trigger escalation under the bias surveillance framework.

---

# 9. Data Quality & Integrity Controls

All RWE data must undergo:

Provenance verification

Timestamp integrity checks

Missingness analysis

Signal plausibility validation

Low-integrity data must be excluded from evidence claims.

---

# 10. Analysis & Review Cycle

RWE review occurs on a:

Rolling monitoring basis

Scheduled periodic analysis (e.g., quarterly)

Event-triggered analysis following safety signals

Findings must be reviewed by qualified clinical and data experts.

---

# 11. Registry Integration

RWE outputs must be anchored to the DeSci registry, including:

Study identifiers

Data source summaries

Analysis methodologies

Key findings and limitations

Review dates and responsible parties

Registry entries are immutable once published.

---

# 12. Regulatory Reporting Use

RWE may support:

Post-market surveillance obligations

Safety update reports

Regulatory audits and inspections

Model lifecycle documentation

RWE must never be misrepresented as randomized clinical trial evidence.

---

# 13. Ethical & Consent Constraints

RWE activities must:

Respect patient consent boundaries

Use de-identified or pseudonymized data where possible

Avoid secondary use beyond approved scope

Undergo ethics review where required

Evidence generation must not burden or surveil patients unnecessarily.

---

# 14. Prohibited Uses

The following are prohibited:

Using RWE to mask known safety issues

Selective reporting of favorable outcomes

Retroactive consent assumptions

Commercial exploitation of RWE data

Violations constitute a governance and ethics breach.

---

# 15. Regulatory Alignment

This plan aligns with:

FDA Real-World Evidence Framework

EMA RWE guidance

EU AI Act post-market monitoring

ISO 14155 (Clinical investigation principles)

GxP-aligned post-market surveillance expectations

---

# 16. Ethical Position

Evidence without integrity is propaganda.
Evidence without humility is risk.

RWE exists to reveal truth, not to defend systems.

---

# Status
Active – Mandatory Post-Deployment Evidence Framework
